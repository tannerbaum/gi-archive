Supergiant Games’ follow up to the critically acclaimed Bastion has gotten a release date. Transistor is hitting PlayStation 4 and PC on May 20, according to a blog post by creative director Greg Kasavin. 
Transistor can be purchased for $20 through the PlayStation Store, Steam, or directly through Supergiant Games’ website. There is currently no option to pre-order the game, but the studio is looking into it.
Supergiant Games debuted Transistor at last year’s PAX East. This year a near-final build of it running on PS4 is playable at booth 892.
The post also featured three new screenshots showing off Transistor's environment, which can be seen in the media gallery below.

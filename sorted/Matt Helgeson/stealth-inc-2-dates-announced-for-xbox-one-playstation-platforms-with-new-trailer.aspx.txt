  Stealth Inc 2 Dates Announced For Xbox One, PlayStation Platforms With New Trailer






The sequel to the well-received Stealth Inc hits Xbox One, with PC and PlayStation platforms to follow next week.
Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones is out today for Xbox One, with PC (via the Humble Store), and PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita on April 7. It's also a Cross Buy game for PlayStation, meaning that one purchase gets you the game on all three systems.
Like the original (which Curve Digital says sold over 500,000 copies across all platforms), Stealth Inc 2 combines 2D platforming, "Metroidvania"-style exploration, and stealth mechanics with an infectious comedic edge. Stealth Inc 2 adds new weapons and gadgets as well as the ability to create levels and share them with other users online. It also has lots of funny hats, which is never a bad thing.
The game will sell for $14.99. There is also the Stealth Inc 2: Ultimate-est Edition which will include all the game's DLC, plus full versions of Stealth Inc and Stealth B-----d (the freeware game on which the original was based).
To get an idea of what the game has in store for you, watch the official announcement trailer below.

Our TakeI completely missed the first one, but after reading about the original and watching this trailer, I'm pretty excited about the sequel.

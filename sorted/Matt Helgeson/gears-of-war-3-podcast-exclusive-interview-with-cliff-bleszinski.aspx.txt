  Gears of War 3 Podcast: Exclusive Interview with Cliff Bleszinski






We finally have the ability to podcast over the phone, and we put this space age technology to good use in this Special Edition Gears of War 3 podcast. Epic Games' Cliff Bleszinski was kind enough to join us for the first segment, answering questions posed by users here at Gameinformer.com (and delivered by our cover story author Matt Miller). Not surprisingly, he's funny and candid his responses. In the second segment, Miller and host Matt Helgeson are joined by Meagan VanBurkleo and Nick Ahrens who also got to see the game on our cover story trip. The three wax poetic about the changes and improvements coming in this highly anticipated sequel. Finally, as a non-GearsÂ  "bonus segment", Joe Juba and Meagan are on hand to discuss their misgivings on the promising but flawed Alpha Protocol. Basically, Joe was really mad and wanted to vent. Who are we to stop him?

  Special Edition Podcast: Top 50 of 2012 Snubs And Grudges






Our year-end top 50 list always engenders a lot of controversy and discussion amongst our readers, so we decided to sit down for a free-ranging discussion about the games we picked, and air out some of our own personal gripes about the list.

Host Matt Helgeson is joined by Matt Bertz, Matt Miller, Adam Biessener, and Andy Reiner for our special edition "Snubs and Grudges" edition podcast. If you don't agree with every selection on our list, here's some good news: neither do all of the Game Informer editors! Although we picked our list through a scientific and democratic system of bickering in a conference room, there were still some lingering disagreements among the editors -- although not as many as in year's past. We also discuss the reasoning behind some of our picks. We hope you find this an interesting look into the process of choosing a year-end Top 50 list.

This will also be the last Game Informer Show of 2012. We thank you for listening to the show, and all of your feedback through comments, email, and Twitter. Have a happy and safe holiday season.

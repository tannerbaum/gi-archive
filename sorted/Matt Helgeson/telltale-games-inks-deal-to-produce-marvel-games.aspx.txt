  Telltale Games Inks Deal To Produce Marvel Games






Telltale Games has a knack for turning big entertainment properties into great adventure games. Today, the studio announced a partnership with Marvel.
The news came from the Telltale Games' blog:
"Announced this evening in San Francisco, we're excited to reveal an all-new partnership with the incredible team at Marvel Entertainment. We'll be teaming up on the development of an upcoming Telltale game series project set to premiere in 2017!"
Obviously, details are scarce, but this seems like another big coup for Telltale, which has parlayed its success with The Walking Dead into production deals on projects like HBO's Game of Thrones and a new Minecraft game. Given the popularity of Marvel's movies, this could be the biggest Telltale project ever.

Our TakeThis seems like good news for Telltale, though I do worry about how many irons they have in the fire. Also, could we use some of the money from these deals to get a new game engine? They did a nice job with Game of Thrones but the graphics and (especially) the animations look very archaic.Â

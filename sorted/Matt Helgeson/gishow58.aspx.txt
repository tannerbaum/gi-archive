  Game Informer Show 58: Bulletstorm, Killzone 3






This week saw a massive showdown in the shooter genre -- People Can Fly/Epic's gonzo Bulletstorm facing off against Guerilla Games/Sony's sci-fi epic Killzone 3. It's still, February, and we already have what could be two of the year's most intense FPS experiences. Things kick off with Bulletstorm, with Andy Reiner, Bryan Vore, and Matt Bertz joining Matt Helgeson to discuss the game that is bringing the crazy back to the shooter genre -- along with some surprising depth. In the second segment, reviewer Matt Miller stops by to talk Killzone 3, the third in Sony's sci-fi FPS franchise. This is the best game in the series, offering intense, hardcore action. Even better -- it might just give you a reason to break out your Move controller. Miller discusses all these topics and more.

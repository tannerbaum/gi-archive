  Special Edition Podcast: Tomb Raider






We're giving the regular Game Informer Show a rest this week in favor of a special edition podcast for our current cover story, Crystal Dynamic's bold reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. There's been a flurry of interest in this story from the Tomb Raider community, so we thought we'd give our readers a chance to ask the people working on the game questions about the game. Crystal Dynamics' global brand manager Karl Stewart and Tomb Raider franchise director Tim Longo were nice enough to call in to the GI Show, and give some intriguing answers to reader questions (posed by our cover story author Meagan Marie and GI editor Matt Miller). Did your question get asked? You'll have to listen to find out. Either way, this is mandatory for Tomb Raider fans.

Note: The opening and closing music to the podcast is a sneak peak at a track from the game itself.

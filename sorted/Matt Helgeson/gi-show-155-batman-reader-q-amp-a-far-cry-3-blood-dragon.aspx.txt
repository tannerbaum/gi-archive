  GI Show 155: Batman Reader Q&A, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon






This week, we got to speak with some of the leads on Batman: Arkham Origins and ask them questions submitted by readers. Bryan Vore and Matt Miller, both of who were on our cover story trip for the game, helm the first segment. They asked GI readers for questions, and put the best of them to creative director Eric Holmes and senior producer Ben Mattes.

Host Matt Helgeson returns for the second segment with Andy Reiner and Tim Turi in tow. They are here to talk about Ubisoft's excellent Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, a new standalone game in the FC universe that provides a unique and excellent take on 1980s pulp sci-fi and action films.

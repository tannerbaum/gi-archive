  I've Been A Game Journalist My Entire Adult Life: Ask Me Anything






Hey everyone, I've worked here a long time. If you have any questions for me, now would be a good time to ask them.
I wanted to do something a little different and interact with the community today, so I'm doing an AMA. I've been around the old video game block a few times, and I'm here to answer your questions about the industry (within reason). Leave them in the comments section, and I'll do my best to answer them.

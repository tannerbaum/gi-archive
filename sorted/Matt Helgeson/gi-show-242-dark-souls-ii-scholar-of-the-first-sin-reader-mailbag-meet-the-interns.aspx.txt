  GI Show 242: Dark Souls II: Scholar Of The First Sin, Reader Mailbag, Meet The Interns 






We talk about the new-gen re-release of Dark Souls II, dig into the Reader Mailbag for questions, and introduce you to the current GI interns.

First off, Tim Turi and Dan "Dark Souls" Tack talk about Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, a deluxe, graphically and gameplay enhanced new-gen and PC version of the excellent From Software game. It features all the DLC, plus some great improvements to the game's story.

Next up, host Matt Helgeson is joined by Bryan Vore, Joe Juba, Jeff Marchiafava, and Ben Hanson to answer some of the best reader submitted questions in the triumphant return of Reader Mailbag.

Finally, GI interns Elise Favis, Justin Mikos, and Jon Gregory stop by to let you know a little bit more about themselves and their experiences as gamers and at GI.

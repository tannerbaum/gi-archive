  Special Edition Podcast: Dishonored






The co-creative directors of Arkane Studios' upcoming stealth/assassin game Dishonored, Harvey Smith and Raf Colantonio, were kind enough to join us on the Game Informer Show this week to answer the community's questions about the game. Listen in to get firsthand explanations about Dishonored's weapons, its enigmatic protagonist, and what it's like to work with Bethesda.

Make sure to pay attention at the 37-minute mark to get an interesting tidbit that even we hadn't heard before.

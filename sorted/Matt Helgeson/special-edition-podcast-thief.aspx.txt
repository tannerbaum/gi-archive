  Special Edition Podcast: Thief






We asked for questions about the upcoming Thief reboot from our readers, then posed them two of the game's leads.
This podcast was hosted by Game Informer's Ben Reeves and Bryan Vore, who asked the questions to Eidos Montreal lead producer Stephane Roy and lead level designer Daniel Windfeld Schmidt.

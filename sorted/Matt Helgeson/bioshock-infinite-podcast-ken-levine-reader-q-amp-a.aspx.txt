  BioShock Infinite Podcast: Ken Levine Reader Q&A






BioShock Infinite is on pace to become one of the most anticipated games ever. Our cover story kicked off the sensation, and to tide you over through the many long months until its release, Game Informer is devoted to giving you as much Infinite coverage as is humanly possible. To that end, we were lucky enough to get Irrational creative director and series creator Ken Levine to call in to our podcast studio as a guest for this special edition podcast. For over a half-hour, Ken was kind enough to answer reader-submitted questions about the game, giving us thoughtful answers that ranged in topic from politics to Tears for Fears. If you are as excited about BioShock Infinite as we are, this is a mandatory listen.

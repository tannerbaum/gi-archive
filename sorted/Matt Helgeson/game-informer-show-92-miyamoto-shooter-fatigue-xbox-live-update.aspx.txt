  Game Informer Show 92: Miyamoto, Shooter Fatigue, Xbox Live Update






This week, we decided to switch up our usual game-centered format for something different. To that end, we have a long show devoted to three discussion topics. First up, host Matt Helgeson is joined by Phil Kollar and Matthew Kato to discuss the recent reports that Nintendo icon Shigeru Miyamoto is planning to retire from his current post overseeing the company's internal game development -- a report Nintendo has since denied. We discuss the possibility that Miyamoto is considering a change in role, and what that would mean for Nintendo. In the second segment, Adam Biessener, Matt Bertz, and Tim Turi join in on a discussion about our growing fatigue with the first-person shooter genre. It's the dominant genre in gaming today, but many of the GI staff have been finding themselves more drawn towards other types of games lately, due to the often formulaic nature of many shooters. Finally, we wrap things up with Matt Miller and Bryan Vore's quick impressions of the new Xbox Live Dashboard update and the recent 3DS firmware update.

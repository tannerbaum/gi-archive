  Special Edition Podcast: Grand Theft Auto V






As part of our month of ongoing coverage of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V, we assembled a crack team of GI editors to discuss the game in a special edition podcast -- including cover story author Matt Bertz.

Regular GI Show host Matt Helgeson welcomes Matt, Jeff Marchiafava, and Dan Ryckert into the booth for a lengthy and detailed discussion of what we've seen of the game so far.

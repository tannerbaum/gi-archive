  The Game Informer Show Episode 20






Episode 20 of the Game Informer Show features some down and dirty discussion of Sony's visceral epic God of War III. This PS3 exclusive has a lot to live up to, but GI editors Joe Juba, Andy Reiner, and Jeff Cork feel the game has more than what it takes to match up to the legacy of the first two games in the series. Listen is as they discuss the game's ridiculously huge set pieces, exciting combat, and one (slightly embarrassing) misstep. The second segment features Matt Bertz, Meagan VanBurkleo, and Nick Ahrens giving us their impression of the recent Game Developers Conference. Features lots of insider information and hands-on impressions of Sony's PlayStation Move motion controller. This episode features music by Minneapolis electro-rockers Digitata

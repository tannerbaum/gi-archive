  GI Show 243: Guitar Hero Returns, Mortal Kombat X, Matt's Last Show






This week, we talk about the return of Activision's Guitar Hero, Mortal Kombat X, and I say goodbye to the Game Informer Show.

We start off with Brian Shea, Matt Miller, and Andy Reiner, who join me to talk about the return of Guitar Hero. We also handicap the upcoming showdown between GH and Rock Band 4.

In the next segment, Brian and Reiner return, joined by Dan Tack to tackle the excellent (and slightly controversial) Mortal Kombat X.

And, in closing, this is going to be my last show as the host of the Game Informer Show. I will be leaving Game Informer to puruse a new career outside of games. It's a bittersweet time for me. I've truly enjoyed being the host of this podcast since its inception, but I'm going to be passing it off to Ben Hanson and Tim Turi, who are have some great ideas for its future. I have no doubt they are going to go on to create a new show that's better than what came before.

I'd like to personally thank every one of you who's listened to the show, commented on the show, or interacted with me via Twitter or email. The support of our Game Informer community has always meant a great deal to me. It was a pleasure and a privilege to make this show for you. I wish you all the best.

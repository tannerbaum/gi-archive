  Goat Simulator Hits Xbox One






Major Nelson has revealed the cult hit will be released for Xbox One tomorrow. 
Goat Simulator became an unlikely hit, largely due to YouTube videos of the game going viral on the Internet. Tomorrow, April 17, it will have a new console to create a ruckus on when it is released for Xbox One. The game is available for purchase now on Xbox Live for $9.99. However, you won't be able to play it until the 17th. An Xbox 360 version of the game will also be released in the near future.

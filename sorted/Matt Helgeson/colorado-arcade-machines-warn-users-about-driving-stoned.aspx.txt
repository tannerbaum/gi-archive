  Colorado Arcade Machines Warn Users About Driving Stoned






Since Colorado legalized marijuana in 2014, stoned driving has been a new hazard of the roads. Now, new arcade machines aim to raise awareness among users.
The retro-looking arcade cabinets are made up to look like a fictional old-school driving games named End Game. However, when you approach the cabinet you see the message: CDOT (Colorado Department of Transportation) reminds you...Playing games while high is legal. Driving is not."
Users can then play a free game of some old school arcade hits like Donkey Kong, Frogger, and Galaxian.
This is just one part of CDOT's effots to help stem the tide of stoned drivers in Colorado.

Solatorobo: Red The Hunter


  Man Your Robotic Steed In Solatorobo




Gamers have plenty of choices when it comes to action RPGs, but how many DS titles let you ride a super-powered robot pet into combat? Solatorobo: Red the Hunter does.
Solatorobo tells the story of Red Savarin, an adventurer for hire who rides a robot mech pet named Dahak. Dahak is at the center of Solatorobo's combat system, allowing Red to pick up and throw enemies, and chain together attacks. Various upgrades can make Dahak stronger and more agile, plus he can also snatch projectiles out of the air and hurl them back at his enemies. Sounds like a pretty good companion to have.
For a better idea of how combat works in Solatorobo, check out the short but sweet clip below. Solatorobo: Red the Hunter will be available sometime this fall.

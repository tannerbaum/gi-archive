Most twin-stick shooters serve up ammo and enemies in
equally infinite proportions, embracing the shoot-everything-that-moves formula
that has come to define the genre. Helldivers is different. While the hordes of
enemies are just as endless, limited ammo and the ever-threatening presence of
friendly fire create a more challenging and calculated shooter.
Full disclosure: I haven't beaten Helldivers yet, and
neither has anyone else. Arrowhead's less subtle take on Starship Troopers tasks players with "defending" Super Earth by
exterminating a trio of extraterrestrial races, and that galactic conquest is a
community-driven campaign that takes 4-6 weeks to complete. While this meta-structure
is a clever addition, it's ultimately little more than window-dressing for the
frantic, co-op focused action. You play Helldivers for the thrill of each
individual battle, not the outcome of the larger war.

Helldivers offers a simple-yet-satisfying gameplay loop. You
select your warfront (bugs, cyborgs, or the alien Illuminate), a randomized
planet to battle on (from one of 12 difficulty levels), and then complete
missions to level up your helldiver, unlock new gear, and upgrade your existing
armaments before jumping back into the fray. This basic structure has a
surprising amount of variety; each of the three alien races features different
enemy types and fighting styles, and objectives offer a healthy number of
variations on taking and defending points, blowing up enemy encampments, and
escorting. Three planet types (jungle, desert, and snow) mix things up further,
as do special hours-long attack and defend events that pop up every couple of
days and award bonus XP.
Like Diablo III, each procedurally generated map in
Helldivers feels unique and familiar at the same time, as does the
moment-to-moment gameplay; I grew comfortable mowing down countless swarms of
hostile aliens (ideally with three friends at my side) while sprinting from one
objective to the next. Brief pauses in the action are typically used to call down strategems from the
heavens to aid you in combat and hopefully keep you alive for what always seems
like a last-second extraction.

Strategems are the real draw of Helldivers' deep progression
system and gameplay variety, supplying you with everything from rocket
launchers and airstrikes to your own overpowered mech. Surviving higher
difficulty levels requires coordinating who brings what to the fight and
working in constant unison, but even on lower difficulty levels, Helldivers
doubles down on communication and teamwork; you're just as likely to be offed
by an inaccurate squadmate or your own automated turret as an enemy ambush.
Even after the unlocks dry up, the challenge and camaraderie that Helldivers offers makes it hard not to attempt "just one more mission"
with your friends, a proposition made all the more enticing by the inclusion of
four-player couch co-op. I still don't know how the community-driven galactic
campaign will shake out over the coming weeks, but contributing to the larger
war effort is just one more welcome excuse to enlist.

The Edge
Helldivers is a cross-buy, cross-play, cross-save title for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita. While the core gameplay is identical, the loading times, visuals, and framerate get steadily worse across the three respective platforms, making the PS4 version the clear favorite.

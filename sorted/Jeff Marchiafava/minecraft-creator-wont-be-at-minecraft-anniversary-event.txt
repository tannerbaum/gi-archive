  Minecraft Creator Won’t Be At Minecraft Anniversary Event






            Despite being the original creator of Minecraft, Markus “Notch” Persson won’t be included in any of Microsoft’s anniversary plans, the company has told Variety. A Microsoft spokesperson told the outlet that “[Persson’s] comments and opinions do not reflect those of Microsoft or Mojang and are not representative of Minecraft.”

Persson sold both Minecraft and his development studio Mojang to Microsoft for $2.5 billion back in 2014, and the spokesperson reiterated to Variety that Persson hasn’t had any involvement with the game since then. Microsoft's attempts to distance its mega-popular, family-friendly franchise from Persson were underscored last month when the company removed incidental mentions of him from the game.

Minecraft's 10-year anniversary event will take place on May 17 at Mojang’s offices in Stockholm, Sweden.

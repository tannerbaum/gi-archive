  Time For A Kratos Boss Fight Montage!






This weekend is all about being thankful: For your family, for good food, and for whatever crazy things Ben wrote down in his demented Thanksgiving Day list. But here's another thing you should be thankful for: the fact that you're not a god who has ticked off Kratos. And with that flimsy setup, let's take a look at a compilation of every boss battle from the epic God of War trilogy.
Our kudos to YouTube user Qwerasdf011 for putting together high-def videos of Kratos' gory exploits.

  See Evolve Gameplay In Action






Ever since our Evolve cover reveal, readers have been asking when they can see gameplay footage of the new multiplayer-focused shooter from the creators of Left 4 Dead. The wait is finally over: Our new video contains action of Evolve's first four hunters going head-to-head with the mighty Goliath.
Tim Turi, Jeff Cork, and I discuss our early thoughts on the game, including the differing play styles of the monster and hunters, how Evolve compares to Left 4 Dead, and the game's progression. Don't worry, though – the gameplay is the main focus of the video, and you'll get plenty of good looks at what makes this new-gen-only shooter shine. 
Sorry, this video is not available

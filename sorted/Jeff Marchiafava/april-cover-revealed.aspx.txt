  April Cover Revealed






Valve is known for making quality first-person shooters: The Half-Life series redefined how players think about the FPS genre, while titles like Team Fortress and Left 4 Dead took team-oriented multiplayer action to a whole new level. But among Valve's stable of popular shooters, one game stands alone: the mind-bending puzzler, Portal.

Our 12-page cover story gives you the first details on Portal 2's new gameplay mechanics, storyline, and some surprising new twists.
Other features in April's issue include a celebration of The Sim's 10th anniversary with creator Will Wright, and an interview with Yoshinori Kitase and Motomu Toriyama about the making of Final Fantasy XIII. We also talk to PopCap founder Jason Kapalka about the state of casual gaming, then grill some big name developers to find out why games don't feature more female protagonists in our 4-page feature, The Gender Gap.

Hands-on previews of Alan Wake, Red Dead Redemption, and Lost Planet 2 are just a few of the upcoming games this issue covers, while reviews of Just Cause 2, Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening, and the highly-anticipated God of War III round out the issue.
There are two versions of the cover this issue – the second one reverses the portals. Here's what it looks like:

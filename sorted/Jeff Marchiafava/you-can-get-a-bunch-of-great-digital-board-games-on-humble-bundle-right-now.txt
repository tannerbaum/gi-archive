  You Can Get A Bunch Of Great Digital Board Games On Humble Bundle Right Now






            Digital board games have exploded in popularity in recent years, and Humble Bundle is well aware. The website has offered numerous digital board game bundles in the past, mostly for Android. Its latest collection is all about Steam games, and contains some sizable juggernauts.

For $1 or more, you can get Ticket to Ride: First Journey, a kid-friendly version of Alan R. Moon’s classic set collection game, Gloom, Love Letter, and Twilight Struggle, one of the highest-ranked board games of all time.

If you beat the average donation (currently $8.85), you can also pick up Steam versions of Pandemic, Carassonne, Ascension, and Mysterium.

Pledging $12 gets you two more games: Pathfinder Adventures: Obsidian Edition, and Jamey Stegmaier’s highly vaunted alternate history strategy game, Scythe, which is also one of the highest-ranked board games of all time. All in all it’s not a bad way to build up a solid digital board game collection, for a fraction of the cost of a single physical game.

Interested gamers have just over 7 days to buy into the bundle by clicking the link below. For more on digital board games, check out my Digital Board Game Spotlight features on Isle of Skye, Stockpile, and Jaipur.

I haven't played the Steam versions of these games, so your mileage may vary, but the Android versions of Twilight Struggle, Pandemic, Carcassonne, and Ascension are all great. If you're interested in digital board games, this is a solid deal.

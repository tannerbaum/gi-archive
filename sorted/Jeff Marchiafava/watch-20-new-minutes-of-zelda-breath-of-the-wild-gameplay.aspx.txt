   Watch 20 New Minutes Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Gameplay






We have 20 new minutes of gameplay footage from The Legend
of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, taken directly from the Nintendo Switch.
While the demo takes place in the same area that Nintendo
showed off during E3, this is the first time we have direct feed from the
company's new console. Check it out below to see more sky-gliding,
horse-flipping action from Link, and to get a sense of what the final visuals
will look like when the game launches on March 3.

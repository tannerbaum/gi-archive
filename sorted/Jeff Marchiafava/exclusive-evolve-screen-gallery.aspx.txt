  Exclusive Evolve Screen Gallery






Turtle Rock Studios' new multiplayer-focused shooter sports
a variety of exciting features, which we've been discussing throughout the
month in our Evolve bonus
content. Rather than try to convey how visually impressive the game is
through words, however, we thought we'd let you see for yourself in these
exclusive screens from our February
issue cover story.
The screens in the media gallery below show off
Evolve's first four human hunters, the hulking playable monster known as
Goliath, and some of the landmarks located in the jungle map that we played. All in all it's just a fraction of the content Turtle Rock is preparing for the game, but it should give you a good idea of the level of detail the developer is aiming to deliver.
You can see the rest of the screens by subscribing to the magazine, or if you'd rather learn about how the game plays, read our hands-on
impressions. We've got a few more Evolve features coming up soon (including our Q&A;
podcast); make sure you don't miss them by checking out the Evolve hub
throughout the week.

You can also follow our Evolve updates and other stories by following Game Informer on Twitter, Google+, and Facebook.

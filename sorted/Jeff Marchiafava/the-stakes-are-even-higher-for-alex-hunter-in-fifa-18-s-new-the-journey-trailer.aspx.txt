A world of choices await Hunter and gamers alike in FIFA 18's The Journey story mode.
EA debuted The Journey in last year's FIFA 17, which introduced
players to up-and-coming rookie Alex Hunter. This time around, Hunter will be a
little less starstruck, but no less motivated, garnering the attention of some
of the top soccer teams around the world. EA's plans for the mode sound equally
ambitious, with the inclusion of more player customization, voice and mo-cap performances
from a number of real-life stars (including cover athlete Cristiano Ronaldo),
and increased player choices that will drive Hunter's narrative. This year's Journey
mode also contains multiplayer matches and smaller stories featuring other playable characters who
Hunter meets in his globe-spanning career. 
The Journey was one
of the highlights of last year's FIFA 17, so we're looking forward to the
improvements EA is prepping for this year's installment, as well as seeing where
Hunter's story takes him next.

  Question Of The Month: What Video Game Power-up Would You Want In Real Life?






            In issue 312, we asked readers what super power/ability from a video game character they would want in real life. Now it’s your turn to choose!

You won’t actually be endowed with the power-up, mind you – but you can talk about why you picked it in the comments below. And really, the power to elucidate your thoughts and opinions is way better than shooting lasers out of your eyes or flying or turning invisible and robbing the nearest bank – which wouldn’t work anyway, because everyone would be able to see the giant money bags floating out the door.

So yeah, share your preferred power-up in the comments below, and what you would use it for!

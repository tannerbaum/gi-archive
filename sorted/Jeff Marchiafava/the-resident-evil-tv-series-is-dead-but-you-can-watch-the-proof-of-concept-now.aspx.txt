   The Resident Evil TV Series Is Dead, But You Can Watch The Proof Of Concept Now






A few years ago, Mance Media and independent filmmaker
Shawn Lebert announced
they were working on Arklay, a television
drama based in the Resident Evil universe. Arklay
centered on detective James Reinhardt, who was tasked with investigating a
series of homicides in Raccoon City, which involved a certain virus that gamers
are all too familiar with. Arklay was
supposed to release in 2015, but went dark shortly after the announcement,
leading many gamers to assume the worst.
Turns out those assumptions were indeed correct, but there's
something of a silver lining. While the media company ended up passing on Arklay, Lebert has now released the
proof-of-concept short film. Despite any direct references to Resident Evil having been removed from
the video, it still gives RE fans an idea of what the series could've been,
while providing closure to the project.
Watch the video below, and tell us what you think in the
comments.

  Evil Dead: The Game – Exclusive Demon Gameplay (4K)






            As the Demon in Evil Dead: The Game, you have a lot of work to do – after all, you have to beat 4 other players! However, you have a rather nasty toolbox at your command, full of traps, possessions, and even the ability to summon horrific boss monsters that will destroy your prey. Of course, the first challenge is simply to find them, a task that can be daunting given how big the map is. Survivors can do things that give away their position too like riding in cars, so it’s important to pay close attention to the minimap.

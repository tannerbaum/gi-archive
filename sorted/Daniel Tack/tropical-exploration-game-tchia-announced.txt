  Tropical Exploration Game Tchia Announced






            Announced today at The Game Awards 2020, Tchia is a game inspired by New Caledonia (A tiny island in the Pacific Ocean). You can swim, climb, glide and sail your way around an island paradise. You can even play the ukulele. The titular character Tchia can take control of any animal or object. There are over 30 playable animals to control and hundreds of various objects. Are you ready to explore a wide-open island and discover its mysteries?

You can explore terrain in a variety of creative ways and even customize your boat. On your sweet water ride, you can explore abandoned shipwrecks, coral reefs, and lagoons. Playing music can have a variety of effects, like altering the weather or summoning your animal friends. Unlocking various melodies can open up your options. And there are plenty of other tools to master as well, including a camera, slingshot, compass, and flashlight.

Tchia uses local talent and traditional languages from New Caledonia to vocalize the characters, so subtitles are available in English, French, Russian, Chinese, German, and more.

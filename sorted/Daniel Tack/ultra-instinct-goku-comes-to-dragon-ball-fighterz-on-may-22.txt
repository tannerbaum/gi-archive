  Ultra Instinct Goku Comes To Dragon Ball FighterZ On May 22






            Today, Bandai Namco showed off Ultra Instinct Goku in action with an action-packed new trailer. You know what they say when it comes to Dragon Ball - there's just never enough Goku. Though I could go for a little more Ginyu Force.

Check out the trailer below for a look at what this character has to offer when he arrives on May 22!

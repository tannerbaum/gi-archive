  Spiritual Successor To Hexen 2 Graven Arrives in 2021 






            3D Realms, 1C Entertainment, and Slipgate Ironworks are bringing the spiritual successor to Hexen 2 to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC in 2021. If you don't remember Heretic or Hexen, that's okay, they're pretty ancient. Ancient and awesome.

The Hexen franchise followed hot on the heels of Doom and provided the same sort of brutal, gory FPS action, but with swords and sorcery instead of shotguns. Magic power ruled the day as you'd blitz through unkempt acolytes. Tapping into the ancient FPS era, Graven allows for split screen co-op for two or up to four player online action.

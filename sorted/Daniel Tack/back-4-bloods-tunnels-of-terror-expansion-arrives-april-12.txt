The update includes two new cleaners, Sharice and Heng, and three kinds of warped ridden to face-off against. Yes, that’s a fire axe that Sharice is wielding, so the undead are in serious trouble. The potentially much bigger news is that a new PvE experience is also coming with this update, the ridden hives. Of course, there are all kinds of new loot to be had as well, so that should have cleaners crawling back to camp to take on these new threats. Warped chests, new cards, and legendary weapons are all on deck to help fight back against the undead tide.

The Tunnels of Terror is scheduled to land on April 12 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you planning to head into the tunnels?

  Deathmatch Is Coming To Valorant This Week






            Act II comes to Valorant this week, and there's a lot to talk about. Obviously a new Act comes with a new battlepass full of cosmetics to unlock. There's also a new Glitchpop skin set that's full of neon and spark, so that's pretty cool too. But perhaps the most intriguing development is the addition of a new game mode - Deathmatch. Free-for-all deathmatch allows 10 players to go at it with no abilitiesÂ and infinite cash, so all guns are available.

This mode is all about gunplay and encourages plenty of action as players fight to be the first to 30 kills or the most kills at the 6 minute mark. Players drop health packs, UAV pings keep campers from being safe, and yes, respawning is a thing in this game mode. Since we're a while after launch, I'm wondering if the Valorant playerbase will peel off from the tactical play they've been mastering to blow off some steam between big matches - or if an entire new segment will be interested in this mode.

Check out the trailer below for a look at all things Glitchpop!

  Darkest Dungeon II | Game Informer Live






            Join us for a doomed caravan ride through the most tenebrous of places.  Darkest Dungeon II is a lot different from the original title but retains tons of signature style. Come check out how the game's new structure works as we dive into Early Access on PC. There will be many epic battles and massive meltdowns along the road as we attempt to carry hope to the end of the world. It all begins at 2 PM CST!

Join us live on Twitch for all the action! A Game Informer Twitch subscription also gets you access to our VIP discord, you can check out more details on that here.

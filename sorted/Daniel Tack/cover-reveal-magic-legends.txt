  Cover Reveal – Magic: Legends






            The world of Magic: The Gathering has made its way into many games over the years. Now, Cryptic Studios is building the universe from its card counterparts to entice players with a new way to engage with the longstanding IP. Grab your Serra Angels and Earth Elementals as you smash legions of foes, enhance your deck, and create a planeswalker to your highly customized specifications in an MMO action/RPG shell. We visited Cryptic Studios in Los Gatos, Calif., to see what's cooking for this free-to-play monster mash coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

We take a deep dive into the game, and have exclusive gameplay impressions and videos to share. Build a deck of 12 cards that constantly cycle, with 4 active cards and a slew of handy abilities to smash your way through endless monsters and maps. Combine buffs, spells, and summons to weave your way through lands from Magic: The Gathering, like Shiv and the Caligo Morass.

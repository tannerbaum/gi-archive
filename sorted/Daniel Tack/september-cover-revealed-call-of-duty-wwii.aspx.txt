  September Cover Revealed – Call Of Duty: WWII






After years of future combat, boosting, jetpacking, and exosuits, Call of Duty returns to grounded, gritty combat with one of history's greatest conflicts. Sledgehammer Games is targeting historical accuracy and a squad's story for the single-player campaign, a terrifying horror tale that lacks the camp and comedy of other recent entries for co-op zombies, and an all new socially-charged multiplayer experience featuring 48-player Headquarters space and War mode. We visited Sledgehammer Games to delve into each of these distinct gameplay offerings, get hands-on time with zombies and multiplayer, and learn exclusive details on many aspects of the game in our cover story.

Call of Duty isn't the only gigantic feature in the issue this month, however. We also traveled to Japan to visit Game Freak, the creators of Pokémon, to get the full history of the series and talk about what's in store for the future on Switch. We explored deeper into Game Freak's studio than any western outlet has ever been allowed and were able to not only see where Pokémon is made, but where its creators hold their meetings, eat lunch, and even create the series' iconic soundtrack. In the issue you will find 12 pages of content covering the studio's history and read development stories for every core Pokémon RPG it has created. And during the first half of the month we will have additional written features and video interviews with Game Freak co-founder, producer, director, and composer, Junichi Masuda, and Sun and Moon's director, Shigeru Ohmori. You can check out the trailer below to learn about all of our planned coverage.

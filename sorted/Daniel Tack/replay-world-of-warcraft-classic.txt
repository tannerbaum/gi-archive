  Replay – World of Warcraft: Classic






            Join Andy McNamara, Andrew Reiner, and Dan Tack as they party like it's 2004 with the World of Warcraft: Classic beta. Launching later this summer, WoW Classic will bring hordes of orcs and humans old and new to the original experience that redefined a genre and games as a whole. Are you going to grab 39 friends and take on Ragnaros?

For more Replay, come back to this website (or our YouTube channel) in seven days. 

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

            Are you ready to brave ill-lit winding roads and take on misshapen aberrations? Of course you are. So come join us on a caravan ride through an apocalypse in Darkest Dungeon II! Darkest Dungeon II contains some of the same characters and combat from the original title, but it’s an entirely new experience. 

Much has changed, and gone is the peaceful ever-growing hamlet. Instead, you must forge your way with different tools each run, hoping to make your way to the mountain and put an end to an ostensible ancient evil that’s unraveling the entire world. Will we survive? Probably not. But with perseverance, we may just find our way. Come join us for a very early look at Darkest Dungeon II with this episode of New Gameplay Today. Darkest Dungeon II is available on Early Access on PC starting tomorrow.

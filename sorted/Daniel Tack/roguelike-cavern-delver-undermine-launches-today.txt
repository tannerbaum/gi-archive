  Roguelike Cavern Delver UnderMine Launches Today






            Looking for a new roguelike crawl to test your reflexes as you dive deep into the caverns to challenge bosses, collect loot, and upgrade your options? UnderMine is leaving Early Access today, bringing version 1.0 to Xbox One and PC. If you have Xbox Game Pass, it's on there too.

The latest version of the game brings with it new items, a "bomb build" to play around with, endgame content,  a final boss and a real deal ending.

That's a lot to take on if you're used to messing around with bats and slimes in Early Access. Check out the new trailer below!

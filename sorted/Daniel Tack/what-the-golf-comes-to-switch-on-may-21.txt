  What The Golf Comes To Switch On May 21






            Fans of silly things and a truly ridiculous take on golf will be happy to know that Triband's What the Golf? is coming to Switch next week on May 21. 

The Switch version of the game includes a local 2-player party mode so that you can really get into the insane physics-based lunacy.  The mode is "coming first" to Switch so we may see it on other platforms later.

For the full announcement and a look at just a few of the nutty things that can happen, take a gander at the trailer below!

  Check Out Five Minutes Of The Upcoming Ashes of Ariandel Dark Souls III DLC




Dark Souls III's first chunk of DLC, Ashes of Ariandel, arrives on October 25th on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. 
If you're looking for a sneak peak of what to expect, Bandai Namco has unveiled a new five minute video packed with action. Be warned, if you're trying to avoid spoilers, you should probably skip the video and wait for the DLC. However, if you're looking for a taste of things to come, it's a fairly hearty helping of some new environments and action!

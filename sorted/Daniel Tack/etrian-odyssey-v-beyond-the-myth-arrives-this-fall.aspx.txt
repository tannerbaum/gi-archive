Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth


  Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth Arrives This Fall




Here in the west, we've been wondering for a while when the next Etrian Odyssey would be making its dungeon-crawling debut over here, and now we know. The map-making, FOE-fighting (I'm not going to explain what FOE stands for because it can be super confusing, but basically these are roaming monsters that can be stronger than bosses and drop great loot if you can take them down), and character customizing comes to North America this fall.
For lovers of the classic RPG dungeon crawler format, the Etrian series continues to provide that old-school feel with crisp visuals and significant challenges. There's nothing quite like cobbling together your own map as you explore dungeon tiles, or having a treasure hunt turn into a disaster as a FOE slaughters your whole party in seconds. Endless labyrinths, turn-based battles, and grinding for new abilities give the series a special feel that can be tough to find anywhere else.
A new E3 trailer doesn't show much, but since the game has been out in Japan for some time now, there's lots out there if you want to go looking. Personally, I'm going to go in blind when it arrives this fall.

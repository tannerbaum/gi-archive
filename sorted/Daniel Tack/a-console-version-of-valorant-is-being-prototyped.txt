  A Console Version Of Valorant Is Being Prototyped






            First-person tactical shooter Valorant just came out of beta, with a new character, mode, and map. In an interview with GameSpot, Riot Games said that a console Valorant is being prototyped.

Valorant plays a lot like Valve's Counter-Strike, with a focus on team communication, round-to-round economy, obstructing sight, and using information to make big plays.

Valorant also adds "hero shooter" abilities to the mix, leading to serious potential to set up game altering scenarios by bringing someone back to life or area-denying with poison.

A game mode that was added on launch, Spike Rush, allows for quick rounds, random guns, big powerups and fast games to go along with the marathon sessions that the standard game type fosters. But there's a big question for the PC-centric title right now - is it ever going to come to console?

Riot followed up the prototype statement with a caveat that the game may not translate to console play. 

"We are definitely prototyping that right now," Donlon told GameSpot. "But there's a way to play this game and there's a way to experience this game that we're not entirely sure translates completely to console play."

You can check out the entire interview and more details over at GameSpot.

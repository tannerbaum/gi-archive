  Check Out The Lord of The Rings: Gollum Trailer






            The Lord of the Rings has no shortage of entries in the game world. In 2021, the world of Frodo, the hobbits, and much much more gets a new treatment from Daedalic Entertainment. It's a game where you play as everyone's favorite misshapen creature, Gollum.

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is currently scheduled to arrive on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC. Maybe the game is about like, eating fish or something. Tasty schmeat. Or maybe you have long sequences where you talk to yourself or mutter about tricksy little hobbitses. We just don't know!

A new trailer highlights... well, not much of anything, but it does let you know this game is still happening. Check it out below and let us know what you think.

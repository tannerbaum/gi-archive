  Elite Dragon Weapons Come To Valorant This Week






            Valorant's weapon skin arsenal already includes flashy colors, special animations, and more. Starting this weekend, things are about to heat up on that front quite a bit with the addition of the elderflame collection. A trailer highlights a lot of what you can expect to see, which amounts to a lot of fire, scales, and smoke. These special additions to existing armaments may be cosmetic, but they definitely have a lot of style to them.

The elderflame collection is scheduled to become available in the Valorant shop on 7/10. The price point is around $90 for the full collection based on a tweet from Valorant's revenue lead Joe Lee, but they won't give you an edge in combat - unless you count looking cool.

So the bundle is 2475 x 4 = 9900 VP

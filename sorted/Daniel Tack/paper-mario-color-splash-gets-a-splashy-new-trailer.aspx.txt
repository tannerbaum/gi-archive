Paper Mario: Color Splash


  Paper Mario: Color Splash Gets A Splashy New Trailer




Paper Mario: Color Splash is hitting Wii U on October 7, and there's a new trailer featuring all kinds of bells, whistles, and dollops of paint to check out. 
After some extensive time with the title at PAX West 2016, I'm definitely curious to see how things shake out for the precision-tapping turn-based combat of the upcoming Mario RPG. 
The trailer features a solid mix of gameplay, environments, and a host of characters and foes, so give it a look if the hammer-slamming, pig summoning, card-painting combat piques your interest.

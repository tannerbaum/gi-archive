Darkest Dungeon is definitely one of my favorite games that hit this year, an uncompromising dungeon dive with a unique aesthetic and unforgettable characters. I'm excited to see how some of the improvements that have trickled out into the PC version resonate with a whole new audience as the title comes to console and handheld. Check out my review of the PC version here! (Any game that lets me use the word aphotic is automatically awesome in my book.)

  Check Out An Exclusive Look At Magic: Legend's Shiv






            If you've followed the rest of our Magic: Legends coverage, you'll know we took a deep dive into Benalia and the Caliogo Morass, from its dark swamps to decadent interiors. Today we're showing off a different zone - the island of Shiv. Home to the iconic Shivan Dragon, the island sports a multitude of goblins, elementals, and other dangerous denizens to mop up as you interact and explore with characters like the plucky immortal goblin Squee. Check out the commentary-free video and the cover hub for more on Magic: Legends!

  Elden Ring: The Game Informer Cover Companion






            Did you get a chance to check out the 18-page cover story on From Software’s Elden Ring? Join Dan Tack and Alex Van Aken to discuss 10-hours with the game, diving into various features, mechanics, and details. During the conversation, we chatted about some new information that didn’t make it into the cover story itself, along with some broad takeaways from the game.

Be advised there are topics that some may consider spoilers in this conversation, so if you’re looking to go into Elden Ring completely unknowing, check out another video instead.

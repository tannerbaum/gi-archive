  You'll Want To Sell Your Soul To The Devil For These Cuphead Construction Sets






Cuphead wowed us with its 1930s-inspired, hand-drawn animation, and it's wowing us again in 3D with three new construction sets from McFarlane Toys.

The sets include Chaotic Casino, Devil's Throne, and Devious Dice and feature familiar characters like The Devil, King Dice, Mugman and, of course, the titular Cuphead. Not only can you build each character though, you can pose them, with each lil' guy having several articulation points.

The Chaotic Casino set is currently unavailable on Amazon, but there's still time to pre-order the other two sets, which both run for $15.99.

Cuphead is coming to Switch very soon. While you wait, read our review of the unforgiving platformer.

  Red Dead Online Adds Explosive New Showdown Mode






Up In Smoke is the latest addition to Red Dead Online's growing list of PvP modes – and it's available in the game starting today.

All players start out with an explosive package and must deliver it to the enemy team's base. Successfully delivering an explosive detonates a piece of their camp. The winning team is the side that can destroy the other team's base first.

This week's featured bonus in the online beta is a 30 percent XP boost on all ability cards. Rockstar Games says that ability cards such as To Fight Another Day, Strange Medicine, and Slippery Bastard will come in handy in Up in Smoke.

If you're looking for a new look, there are some new items in the Wheeler, Rawson and Co. Catalogue this week, including Winter Shotgun Coat, Benbow Jacket, Darned Stockings, and Manteca hat.

Rockstar games added a new racing mode to the game last week that challenges players to hit targets while riding horseback. And if you need more reason to spend time with the hit game, you can listen to an hour-long orchestration of the music of Red Dead Redemption II.

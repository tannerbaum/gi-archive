  You Can Get Fortnite's Season 8 Battle Pass For Free






Epic Games has a valentine for you, and it's a free Fortnite Battle Pass.

While players wait for Season 8 to begin, they can complete 13 Overtime Challenges to nab next season's Battle Pass for free. The Battle Pass gives players two Season 8 outfits instantly, with the potential to earn up to five more. Make sure to complete those challenges soon – the giveaway ends February 27.

Patch v7.40 also brings back gifting for a limited time, from now until February 22. As an extra Valentine's Day bonus, players can send the Heartspan Glider to a friend for free until February 15 at 7 p.m. EST.

Players who are hungry for new game modes will enjoy the new limited time mode – Catch! — which removes guns from the game completely, restricting players to grenades and throwable objects like Port-a-Forts.

You can read the full patch notes on the official Fortnite blog here.

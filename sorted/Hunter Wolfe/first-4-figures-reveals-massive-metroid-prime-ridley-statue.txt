  First 4 Figures Reveals Massive Metroid Prime Ridley Statue






First 4 Figures recently revealed its plans for a high-end, Metroid Prime Meta Ridley statue. It stands at a whopping 37 in. with a 22 in. diameter, and the figure and its base weigh a combined 14.29 lbs. Both the standard and exclusive versions include glow-in-the-dark wings, but the pricier, exclusive edition touts an LED chest panel and eyes that light up, which you can see in the video below.

You can pre-order either version of the statue now for $599 USD on First 4 Figures’ site and there is also a giveaway which ends on July 31. You can read the full details of the giveaway on First 4 Figures’ blog here.

The statue, ironically, comes hot on the heels of news that, Metroid Prime 4 will restart development as Nintendo changes its developer to Retro Studios – the series' original creator.

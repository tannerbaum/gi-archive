  New Character Posters For Avengers: Endgame May Finally Reveal The Fates Of Every Hero Post-Infinity War






            Just one month away from the premiere of Avengers: Endgame, Marvel has released new character posters for the entirety of its superhero lineup, and the photos may finally give us definitive answers about who survived The Snap at the end of Avengers: Infinity War.

We've organized the character posters into two galleries for you below: one features characters we know for certain survived The Snappening. The second gallery, which depicts characters in black and white, features heroes we know turned to dust at the end of Infinity War. Certain characters' fates have been up in the air since Infinity War, like Valkyrie, Shuri, and Pepper Potts, so it's pretty safe to assume their fates based on their character posters: Valkyrie and Pepper's photos are in color, but Shuri (sadly) seems to have bitten the dust.

Avengers: Endgame premieres on April 26, and apparently it's over three hours long. WatchÂ the moody new trailer here, if you haven't already.

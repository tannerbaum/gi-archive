  New Music Is About To Drop On Beat Saber






Beat Saber's lineup of techno tracks was thin when the hit VR rhythm game launched last year, coming in at just 16 original songs. You'll soon have new reason to dust off your lightsabers and jump back in though: new music is coming to the game next week, according to a Tweet on the game's official Twitter account:

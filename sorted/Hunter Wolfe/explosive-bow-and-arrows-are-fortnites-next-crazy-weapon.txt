  Explosive Bow And Arrows Are Fortnite's Next Crazy Weapon






Fortnite's seen every weapon under the sun, from stink bombs to the Infinity Blade. And yet today is first time players can go old-school with the addition of the bow and arrow.

Available via the v8.20 patch, players can wield the Boom Bow in Fortnite's battle royale mode. The bow uses shotgun ammo, which explodes on contact.

There's a new limited-time mode, too; in Sniper Shootout, only sniper rifles spawn on the map. Watch your head!

The Cannonade Launcher is a new weapon this week, exclusive to Save The World mode. The patch notes describe it as "a chaotic, rapid-fire, automatic launcher that shoots small explosive rounds."

Fortnite shows no signs of getting any less crazy – the most recent patch added a "floor is lava" twist to the game's battle royale formula.

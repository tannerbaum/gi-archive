  Play 40 Xbox Game Demos Now As Part Of Summer Game Fest






            So, we heard you liked games. Well, good, because Xbox is making a whopping 40 games available to play right now as Early Access demos as part of Geoff Keighley's ongoing Summer Game Fest. Thanks to ID@Xbox, the Summer Game Demo Fest highlights indie treasures that deserve some major love, including one game that features adorable kittens (who doesn't like kittens?). 

The ID@Xbox Summer Game Demo Fest is going on from now until July 21 and offers gamers a chance to check out titles that may interest them. Maybe even to step out of their box and try out something new, as well!

There are quite a few that I'm personally interested in, especially when it comes to Shedworks' Sable. Sable offers a stunning open world for players to explore, with a unique art style that makes it seem unforgettable. I can't wait to travel through the different landscapes while listening to the smooth sounds of Japanese Breakfast. It looks incredible, but it's only one of the many titles above that has something special to offer players.

  Silent Hill Creator Has A New Horror Game Coming In 2023






            While a new Silent Hill game is still a rumor at best, there is some exciting horror news on the horizon! The Bokeh Game Studio is a new studio with the creator of the Silent Hill franchise and its team is bringing a brand-new horror experience that is expected to drop in 2023. 

Keiichiro Toyama is a horror mastermind and a true talent for those that enjoy this genre. Now that he's back in the game of making games with Bokeh Game Studio, he's leading the charge of an unknown horror adventure that genuinely has us intrigued to learn more. 

Toyama-san recently confirmed in an interview with IGN Japan that the new horror game is currently in development and that the action-adventure game will "appeal to fans of my previous work." He also added, “If anything, this will be more of a horror-oriented game. But we will focus on making this a broader entertainment experience, rather than a hardcore horror game.”

Even better news? He confirms that this new horror game will be releasing on PC as its primary platform, but that won't restrict it to coming out on "as many platforms as possible" with consoles. This is great news considering his past as a Sony-exclusive developer, making it easier for fans of his work to enjoy what is next.

Are you excited to see what Keiichiro Toyama's new horror game will be? Are you hoping the Silent Hill creator sticks true to his style we fell in love with, or are you ready to see him spread his wings a bit? Sound off with all of those horror-related thoughts in the comment section below!

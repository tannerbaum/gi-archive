  Super Smash Bros. Hyrule Stage Recreated In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2






            Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros. and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater are wildly different franchises, but each is iconic in its own right. Now the worlds are colliding in a pretty epic fan-made level that pretty accurately recreates the Super Smash Bros. Hyrule stage within Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. 

The level creator is nothing short of amazing, but it is not without limitations. Those limitations in mind, this Tony Hawk fan did an incredible job at staying faithful to the Hyrule Stage while still able to shred it up in perfect form.

As one Restera user pointed out, the creator did a phenomenal job at making sure to scale the map accordingly, versus focusing on going vertical and losing the functionality of the park itself. 

The creator in question is 'Skyramblez' on YouTube and he made this on the PC version of the game. For those that want to shred to their heart's content, you can find this particular creation by searching "Hyrule Temple" in the Create a Park browser. 

Pretty impressive, right? What do you think about the Hyrule stage recreation? What other games would you like to see collide with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2? Sound off with your thoughts in the comment section below!

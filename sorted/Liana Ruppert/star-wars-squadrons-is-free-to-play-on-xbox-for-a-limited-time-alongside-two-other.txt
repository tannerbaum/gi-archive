  Star Wars: Squadrons Is Free-To-Play On Xbox For A Limited Time Alongside Two Other Titles






            News broke yesterday that the Star Wars franchise is expanding beyond the previous EA exclusivity, beginning with Ubisoft taking its shot at a galaxy far, far away with a new open-world adventure. With Star Wars games being a hot topic, Xbox is offering players a chance to check out Motive Studio's Squadrons experience for free for a limited time. That's not the only game offering a free trial period over on Team Green either. 

For a limited time, Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass Ultimate members can check out Star Wars: Squadrons, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Yooka-Laylee for free starting today until January 17 at 11:59 p.m. PT. This offer is also available for both Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S owners as well, so everyone can join in on the fun as long as they are a member of the Gold or Ultimate programs. 

Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can play three great games this weekend during Free Play Days. Full details here: https://t.co/k4dfl8eAEc

For those that might not have dipped their toes into the Xbox Game Pass pool quite yet, it's a good deal! With this membership, there are two options to choose from with the Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Both offer Team Green fans a chance to play over 100 titles at no additional cost, including day-one launches of first-party titles. With the acquisition of Bethesda, there will be even more incentive to join up with this particular service, not to mention the rumor that Ubisoft+ may be also joining in with its own library in the near future. 

Xbox Game Pass is $10 a month, whereas Xbox Game Pass Ultimate comes in at $15 and includes Xbox Live Gold. It's a pretty good deal, especially for those that are picky with their games.

  Massive No Man's Sky Update Adds New Planets, UI Overhauls, And So Much More






            No Man's Sky has changed so much since its launch back in 2016 and the team over at Hello Games is nowhere close to being done making this space adventure even better. A new update is now live bringing with it new sky patterns, more landscapes, UI changes, and so much more! 

The new No Man's Sky update has a new trailer celebrating all of the recent changes, which you can watch at the top of the article. From the addition of new planets unlocking "millions of untouched new worlds to explore" and new "dramatic" landscapes for players to become familiar with, there is a lot more to discover with the latest update. 

The User Interface and in-game menus have also seen an update with new colors and styles to make it for customizable and more pleasing to each player. 

The studio also has revitalized the already exiting planets with brand-new flora and other mysteries to uncover while seeing what is new. Even the clouds have seen changes, with new weather patterns and ever evolving skies to create a moving atmosphere that feels real and believable. 

From a completely revamped photo mode to new historical stories, there is so much that players can look forward to with the latest No Man's Sky update! To see the full patch, check out the complete breakdown right here. Oh, and meteors! Because yikes.

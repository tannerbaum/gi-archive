  Best VR Games For Your Oculus Quest 2






            The Oculus Quest 2 is now available, offering a wireless virtual reality experience for those craving new adventures. Whether you're looking for a shooter or a way to get some cardio in, here are a few of the best VR games for you to play with your new Oculus Quest 2. 

While the Oculus Quest has its own library, the variety of games is enhanced due to the ability to use the Link as an option to play even more adventures. Some of our recommendations below don't need the Link, but we've noted which ones do require the additional component for transparency. 

Vader Immortal 

Does this require Oculus Link? No.

You fight ... with lightsabers. Enough said. While this game is very short, it's honestly a great workout alternative for those looking to squeeze in some cardio while also still having fun. Plus, again: lightsabers. 

Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners

Does this require Oculus Link? It did at launch, but now a Quest version is available.

If you like The Walking Dead, or just like the zombie genre in general, Saints & Sinners is the perfect VR game for you to check out. It's a single-player adventure that will pit you against zombies in a way that will feel familiar to Walking Dead fans while still retaining a uniqueness that makes it inclusive for all. 

With the heart of the game set in New Orleans, you'll have to deal with warring factions, the deadly undead, and survivors that need your help. This game is the surprise of the year for me personally; I can't recommend it enough. 

Star Wars: Squadrons

Does this require Oculus Link? Yes.

We couldn't get enough of Star Wars: Squadrons but for those pilots that want to take this adventure in a galaxy far, far away to the next level? VR is the way to do just that. Take out X-Wings, be the epic Star Wars character you were always meant to be, and do it all safely from your living room. No IRL Empire encounters needed for this experience. 

Superhot

Does this require Oculus Link? No.

Superhot has been around for a while now, and it's not a VR exclusive. That being said, the VR version of this game is a unique experience all on its own, even if I still haven't managed to successfully nail down the "just chill and be still for a second" aspect of this particular journey. Shoot guns, throw guns, Matrix-style offense ... it's an awesome game and a must-have for any VR owner.  

Star Trek: Bridge Crew

Does this require Oculus Link? No.

This game is great to play with fellow Star Trek fans, though it hasn't seen the same love that many other VR titles on this list has. Take charge of the starship of your dreams through different missions that are great to tackle with friends. While not the most innovative title, Star Trek: Bridge Crew knows its target audience: fans who love to live long and prosper. 

Phantom Covert Ops

Does this require Oculus Link? No. 

This is a game that Splinter Cell fans will like and perfect for those that are big lovers of military-style VR adventures. Be stealthy, get the info needed, and complete objectives correctly in order to beat the story and be the best spec ops person out there. All while in a kayak. 

Myst

Does this require Oculus Link? No.

Myst will send you straight into a mysterious island filled with beauty but it is also shrouded in injustice. You'll need to use both our imagination and your wits in order to uncover the secrets linked to an intense betrayal, offering a narrative that will stick with you long after the credits roll.

If the name sounds familiar, this is a VR spin of the original classic puzzle adventure game with more modernized touches as seen with the puzzles themselves, the game's sounds, and more. 

This is also the only game on the list that isn't available yet, but it is coming this December.  

Half-Life: Alyx

Does this require Oculus Link? Yes. 

 You're missing out!Normally this is where something cool would show.  Your browser is blocking third-party cookies so we're unable to display this content.Try clearing your browser cache, disabling ad blockers, and verifying that cookies are allowed: Verify cookie preferences

Half-Life: Alyx is the third game in the famed Half-Life franchise from Valve. While some were wishing for anything but a VR iteration, the game itself has seen a lot of positive feedback from players that have access to VR. This game is great for longtime fans of the series and newcomers alike, especially for the chance to take on the role of Alyx herself. Small warning though: there are a few epileptic triggers that I would advise being wary of. 

Audica

Does this require Oculus Link? No. 

This is another rhythm game that is more of a shooter, a nice change for those not looking to lightsaber it up with Beat Saber. With Harmonix's music that has won countless awards, this is another great game to either just enjoy or to implement into your daily workout routine. 

Moss

Does this require Oculus Link? No.  

 You're missing out!Normally this is where something cool would show.  Your browser is blocking third-party cookies so we're unable to display this content.Try clearing your browser cache, disabling ad blockers, and verifying that cookies are allowed: Verify cookie preferences

Do you want something adorable to sink into after a hearty day of Star Wars VR? Moss is the perfect experience for that. The adorable protagonist, a mouse named Quill, is too precious for words as he takes to the world around him with a sense of awe and wonder. There is combat too, but the sheer size of this world is the most stunning part.

Beat Saber Multiplayer

Does this require Oculus Link? No. 

Beat Saber is a rhythm game where you use lightsabers to bust a move and burn some serious calories. I was pretty skeptical about it at first, even with so many praising the game, but now? Now I'm hooked. I also blame this game for getting me hooked on the League of Legends K-Pop group K/DA. 

VR has many more tales to discover, including co-op adventures like Wander, Crisis VRigade, and Spaceteam VR. There are sports games like Oculus Quest Golf and Real VR Fishing Quest. There are also horror adventures like Phasmophobia, which I specifically left off of the main list because honestly? I'm just genuinely too scared to try it out in virtual reality. I'm not ashamed, I'm not proud. 

There are a lot of different adventures to take on with the Oculus Quest 2 for all types of gamers and for players of all ages. It's a wireless way to scape somewhere else for a little bit while also taking on new experiences. 

The Oculus Quest 2 is available now. You can learn more about the latest headset through the official website right here.

  Bethesda Reveals New Indiana Jones Game 






            Bethesda just dropped a surprise reveal, teasing a new Indiana Jones game featuring a brand-new original story from Machine Games. Though not a full trailer, we did get a new video teasing the upcoming adventure, an adventure being executive produced by none other than Todd Howard. It just works. 

The first teaser video was shared on the official Bethesda Twitter with a follow-up tweet saying, "A new Indiana Jones game with an original story is in development from our studio Machine Games and will be executive produced by Todd Howard in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. It'll be some time before we have more to reveal, but we're very excited to share today's news!"

While not an announcement many were expecting to see, Machine Games is the perfect fit for this type of adventure. The studio was first founded in 2009 with founding members from Starbreeze Studios making up its bulk. This studio was acquired by ZeniMax Media back in 2010 and from there, the team has focused on story-driven games, including  Wolfenstein: The New Order. 

More will be revealed at a later date but for now, we've got a swanky teaser trailer and our fan hopes and dreams to occupy our minds before more is shared.

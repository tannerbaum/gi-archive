  Outriders Guide: Top 10 Tips You Need To Know






            Introduction

So you've picked up Outriders and you're diving in for the first time with the world of Enoch. Outriders is an enjoyable looter shooter that has more depth than what meets the eye. In order to get the most out of your game time, here are the top 10 Outriders tips we have to make you fully prepared to kick butt and take names in People Can Fly's latest adventure. 

Outriders Guide - Tips for Beginners

The first thing you need to know about Outriders is that it is an always-online title. While always-online typically gets in with live-service games, Outriders is not that. Instead of a slow and steady roadmap for content to release post-launch to make up an eventual complete picture, Outriders is a full game in its own right. There are many ways to make the most out of Enoch and the journey it holds, so let's kick off some of the tips we have to help you do just that.

            Healing 

            Kill and be healed, or go Technomancer. 

            Healing

You won't find healing potions in Outriders, so how do you heal? The most direct way to ensure you don't head into the white light is to kill. Kill a lot. Seriously, that's how you heal, take out any and all enemies in your path and you'll see an immediate green animation near your bar to indicate regeneration to your health. 

Choosing your class impacts your ability to heal, here's a quick breakdown: 

Devastator: Recover health by killing enemies in close range
Tricksters: Recover health (and shields) by killing enemies in close range
Pyromancer: Recover health every time a marked enemy dies via abilities 
Technomancer: Recover health every time damage hits

            Classes

            Choose the class that's right for you. 

            Classes

There are four classes to choose from, as noted above, but which one is right for you? Don't worry, we've got you covered: 

Devastator 

The Devastator is the backbone of any group of Outriders, and that's something I talked a little more about in our Review in Progress. Strong and tough, they control gravity and use the power of the earth to crush their enemies. A close-combat specialist that wades into damage; their powers allow them to leap into the fight, cover themselves in rock-like skin, and send their enemies flying with powerful ground pounds.

Pyromancer 

The Pyromancer is a medium-range class with powerful AoE damage. Wielding the power of fire, Pyromancers cover the battlefield with their blazing fury. The Thermal Bomb turns any enemy within range into a walking explosive that detonates when that enemy dies. Their firewalls tear across the battlefield and flushes enemies out from cover. Pyromancers may not be as durable as Devastators or as mobile as Tricksters, but their explosive arsenal makes them a threat in any situation.

Technomancer 

Technomancers control technology and can manifest weapons of destruction from thin air. This class is especially perfect for those that like engineering-based combat. It’s a flexible combat style that can be built as a crowd-control support character, damage over time monster, heavy ordinance blaster, or a hodgepodge of everything. This is the only class in Outriders that can heal teammates with its powers, which makes them great for teams running together.

Trickster

The Trickster is the hit-and-run damage dealer of Outriders, they're there to cause chaos (much like the name suggests). They operate at their full potential in close combat and are equipped with powers that allow for unrivaled mobility on the battlefield as they flank enemies. They can slow down time, a power that’s great both defensively and offensively, and can teleport around the battlefield. Up close, they wreak havoc with their Temporal Slice, a wide arcing melee attack that turns unfortunate foes to skeletons.

            Melee

            Don't be afraid to just go ham with those fists, there's more to this than you think!

            Melee

Don't be afraid to just go ham with those fists, there's more to playing aggressively than you might think. Not only is meleeing an enemy going to make you feel like a total badass, but it's also going to help you heal, help you control the combat with that particular enemy, and interrupt any attack that your foe has in progress. Control the battlefield; it's yours for the taking. 

To unlock the full potential of your melee power, you're going to want to pay attention to your skill tree. And that, friends, is the perfect segue into our next part. You guessed it, let's talk about skills (to pay those biiilllls).

            Skills

            If only you knew this section was coming. 

            Skills

There are 22 levels for building up your skills in Outriders. When you first start out, you're going to be fleshing out your core abilities.

            Respec

            You're not stuck if you don't want to be. 

            Respec

That's a lot of info above to take in – I get it – but there's another cool facet about skills that you should be aware of: You don't have to be limited to what you choose. In the Perks section, you can modify your build to suit your play style. For me, I play heavy tank, so I invested heavily in beefing myself up with high defenses and with more melee power. Honestly, there are numerous ways to roll your character. My best advice? Play around, try out different things. You might be surprised what feels like the perfect fit and what just feels like a hinderance.

            Hoarder

            Turn on that auto-collect, boo, you'll thank me later. 

            Hoarder

Auto-collection is one of my favorite features in loot-based games, mostly because I'm lazy when it comes to retracing my steps and I don't want to stop shooting. When you're in a fight, there is going to be loot that pops out as a big glowing orb that's colored to the level of loot it is, but sometimes they drop on ledges or in a hot zone you might not be totally willing to wade into yet. To make sure you grab every piece of gear possible, head over into your settings menu. 

Settings > Gameplay > Auto Loot Minimum Rarity 

This will make sure you scoop up everything, which is great for something we're going to dive in next when it comes to dismantling.

            Kidding on the Hoarder bit

            Collect everything but don't KEEP everything. Let me explain:

            So when I said hoard everything, I did mean it. Sort of. But there is merit in getting rid of some of that lower-tiered loot as well. You can dismantle various gear types like armor and weapons to help craft and upgrade better equipment to don when heading back out into danger. You're going to be constantly getting new loot from enemy drops, so pay attention to what's no longer usable and dismantle it, especially for higher-tiered goods. For lower items like Common and Uncommon, you can sell those for money to the vendors in-camp.

            Side Quests

            Side quests are going to be your best friend in Outriders

            Side Quests

I feel like this is a no-brainer, but just in case you might be thinking on skimping out on some of the side quests: don't. Outriders has some downright stunning weapon designs, especially for the Legendary gear types, and a solid way to get those is through the various side quests found throughout the game.

More than that, doing these quests will also better formulate how you see the world you're suddenly in, getting insight into what life looks like for those outside of yourself. This enriches the RPG aspect of this game and makes worldbuilding more rewarding and immersive for players. If you're looking for a story, this is a good chunk of that, so skimping out on them to save some time only hurts your experience.

            Are Mods Worth It? 

            I mean, yeah. 

            Mods

Outriders gives players a lot of freedom to tailor how they want to fight in-game. Mods help to further that customizable experience with different options to equip in order to achieve a certain build. 

Mod types will include buffs, ways to enhance current skills, what your offense looks like in comparison to your defense. They aren't the end-all-be-all of character craftmanship, but like Destiny - they are a vital part of taking your character to the next level.

            Have Fun

            Another no-brainer tip, but this one gets lost in the shuffle a lot. 

            At the end of the day, games are about having fun. Outriders can absolutely be played solo, but it definitely has a special charm when playing with friends. Play around with the different mods, the different weapons. Don't force yourself into a box. People Can Fly did a great job at adding variety into the gameplay mechanics of Outriders, so go ham. Be the chaos machine you've always wanted to be, or be the strategic overseer that keeps your teammates alive. Whatever you do, just make sure you're having fun. Otherwise, what's the point? 

            And that's it! That's our in-depth guide for maximizing your time in Outriders. Interested in our thoughts about the latest game from People Can Fly? You can check out our Review in Progress right here.

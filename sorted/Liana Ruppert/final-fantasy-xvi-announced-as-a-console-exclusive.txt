  Final Fantasy XVI Announced As A Console Exclusive






            We've got our first look at Final Fantasy XVI during the PlayStation 5 showcase and it is epic. Final Fantasy XVI: Awakening takes the series back to its fantasy roots, a far cry from the more modernized take seen in the previous entry. 

While the reveal states this is a console exclusive, the upcoming game appears to also be coming to PC as well as noted at the end of the trailer. One thing is for sure: Shiva makes this reveal and she pretty much can do whatever she wants to us, we don't mind. 

Naoki Yoshida is returning as producer for the upcoming Final Fantasy game and while we don't have release date at this time, Yoshida did mention they will have a much more in-depth reveal next year in 2021. 

While no cars or boy bands, the latest Final Fantasy adventure brings back the combat we love. Take a look at the reveal trailer above and tell us what you think of the first look at Final Fantasy XVI: Awakening in the comment section below!

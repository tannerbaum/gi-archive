  Xbox Game Pass Adds 10 New Games This Month With Star Wars, Nier, And More






            In addition to the 20 new Bethesda games, Xbox Game Pass is adding even more games to the subscription service with popular adventures like Octopath Traveler, Yakuza 6, and more. Oh, and Undertale, which was confirmed earlier this week with exclusive Xbox-only additions.

The Xbox Game Pass is an always-evolving subscription service with a constant influx of new titles added and games being removed to make room. Here is what's coming to (and what's leaving) Xbox Game Pass this month without further adieu.

What is Xbox Game Pass?

For those that may not have Xbox Game Pass yet, it's a deal that you've likely heard a lot about in the past year. It's grown exponentially, and the value is undeniable. For those still on the fence, there are two options to choose from with the normal Xbox Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate. Xbox Game Pass is $9.99, whereas the Ultimate version includes Xbox Live for $14.99. 

It's a solid investment, especially if you're a little pickier when it comes to games. Xbox Game Pass allows players access to over 100 titles at no additional cost outside of the membership, including first-party day one additions and acquired studio games (like Bethesda).

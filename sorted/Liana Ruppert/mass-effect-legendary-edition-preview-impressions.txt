  Mass Effect Legendary Edition Preview Impressions






            The Mass Effect Legendary Edition officially has a release date alongside a shiny new trailer to see all of the differences BioWare made, especially to the first game. Now that we know it's coming this May and what the upcoming trilogy remaster is bringing with it (and what it is leaving behind), we decided to sit down and talk about what our short time with the Legendary Edition was like and what parts fans should be excited for the most. 

Join our chat about our Mass Effect Legendary Edition preview impressions as Alex Stadnik, Kimberley Wallace, and Liana Ruppert dive deep into how the smaller changes made are more important than many might think.

From changes to Ios, to more cohesive elements added to connect the three games together even more – here is what you should know about the Mass Effect Legendary Edition before it arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (with forward-compatible upgrades for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X) this May 14.

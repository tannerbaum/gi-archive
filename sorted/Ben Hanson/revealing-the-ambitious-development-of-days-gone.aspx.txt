  Revealing The Ambitious Development Of Days Gone






With our cover story on Days Gone from Sony Bend, we've highlighted the game's features and shown a lot of new gameplay. With this feature, we wanted to show where and how the game was made. While visiting Sony Bend, we spoke with studio director Christopher Reese, game director Jeff Ross, and creative director John Garvin about the full process of bringing Days gone to life on the PlayStation 4. The three developers started working with each other back on the original Syphon Filter for the PlayStation 1, and all three of them say that this is by far their most ambitious project yet.
Watch our exclusive video below to learn how the project started and some of the biggest growing pains along the way.

  Insomniac's Giant Leap: Developing Disruptor And Spyro The Dragon






We were more than happy to talk to Insomniac's CEO about their upcoming game called Fuse, but we couldn't help ourselves from diving into the studio's outstanding earlier games. There's a lot of stellar ground to cover, but we narrowed it down to Insomniac's leap from their first game Disruptor to the original Spyro the Dragon.
Watch the video below to learn how CEO Ted Price and a small development team built the company, learned the perils of live-action videos, and how the team's obsession with Super Mario 64 informed the design of Spyro the Dragon. I hope you enjoy the video.

  Obsidian's Favorite South Park Episodes






Ever since we decided to put South Park: The Game on the cover of the January issue of Game Informer, we here in the office have been sharing and reciting our favorite moments from the show. From the Asspen episode to the commercial for the "Wild Wacky Action Bike", there are too many incredible episodes from the show's fifteen seasons to choose from. While we were visiting Obsidian Entertainment, we wanted to pick the minds of the team behind South Park: The Game to discover their favorites as well. We hope you enjoy the video, but head on over to the official South Park website to see these episodes in their entirety.

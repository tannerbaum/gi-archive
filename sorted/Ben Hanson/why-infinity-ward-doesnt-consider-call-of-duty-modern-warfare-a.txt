  Why Infinity Ward Doesn't Consider Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare A Political Game






            Earlier this week we published our rapid-fire interview with Infinity Ward's studio art director Joel Emslie, and one of the 129 questions was whether he considered Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to be a "political game". We were surprised when he responded with a quick "no" considering what we know about the game's campaign, which we'll be highlighting later in the week. Later during our cover story trip, we sat down with the game's campaign gameplay director Jacob Minkoff and studio narrative director Taylor Kurosaki and asked them the same question. Watch the interview above to learn why they don't see Call of Duty: Modern Warfare as a political game and how they define the nebulous terminology.

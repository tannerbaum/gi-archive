  Why Journey Is One Of The Best Games Of 2012






Amongst the bombast of shooters and soul-crushing moments of The Walking Dead sits Journey, the PSN exclusive that won over Game Informer's staff and deserves a nod as one of the best games of 2012. The enigmatic title from Thatgamecompany has players controlling a mysterious figure with a flowing scarf as they make their way to the top of a mountain, but the unique aesthetic and novel approach to co-op pushes the game far past the simple premise.
Game Informer editors Jeff Cork and Matthew Kato hailed Journey as their favorite game of the year, watch them discuss with Dan Ryckert the impact that it had on them and what made it stand out.

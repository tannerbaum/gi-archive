  Inside Dishonored 2's Exaggerated Art Direction






While you've already got a glimpse at some of the amazing concept art for Dishonored 2 in a post earlier this month, we wanted to share the direct thoughts from Dishonored 2's art director Sébastien Mitton in this video interview. Mitton was also the art director on the first game, and he's proud of his team for their effort bringing what he sees as the pillars of the Dishonored universe to the new frontier of a city called Karnaca. While visiting Arkane Studios in Lyon, France, for our cover story on Dishonored 2, we spoke with Mitton about what makes Karnaca so special, whether or not designer Viktor Antonov is involved with this game, and why he doesn't want the game's art to just be labeled as "steampunk."
Watch the video below to learn more about the art direction for Arkane's exciting sequel from Sébastien Mitton.

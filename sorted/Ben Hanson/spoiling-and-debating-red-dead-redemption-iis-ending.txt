  Spoiling And Debating Red Dead Redemption II's Ending






            If you're reading this, then I really hope you've finished playing Red Dead Redemption II. As you can tell from our review, we really love the game and it contains a lot to digest and talk through. In the video above, Ben Hanson, Joe Juba, Javy Gwaltney, Matt Bertz, and Leo Vader share their full thoughts on the game's story and ending. This is your official spoiler warning! The conversation went on for so long that we decided to post the audio in the feed for The Game Informer Show podcast as well, so you can click here to subscribe and listen to the full discussion that way if you prefer. We'll also have a full, new episode of The Game Informer Show podcast going live on Thursday.

We hope you enjoy the discussion, and let us know what thought of the game in the comments below.

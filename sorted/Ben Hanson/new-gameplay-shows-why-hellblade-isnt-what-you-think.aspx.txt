  New Gameplay Shows Why Hellblade Isn't What You Think It Is






With our new cover story on Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, we're trying to put a finger on what exactly Ninja Theory has been developing. We've already asked the game's creative director Tameem Antoniades 158 rapid-fire questions about the game and studio, but there's still more to explain. In this video interview with Antoniades, we talk about the balance in Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice game between story experiences, combat, and puzzles. To learn more about our thoughts on seeing a lot of Hellblade in action, check out the latest episode of The Game Informer Show for our impressions.
Watch the video to learn about the team's growing confidence in their story and to see plenty of new gameplay footage.

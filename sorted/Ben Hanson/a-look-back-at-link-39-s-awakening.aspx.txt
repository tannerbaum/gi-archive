  A Look Back At Link's Awakening






With our month of celebrating the Zelda series, we wanted to take the opportunity to look back at one of the best entries.Â The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, the franchise's first handheld title, is remembered fondly by many... and then there's Game Informer's Dan Ryckert. Watch the video to see highlights (and plenty of spoilers) from the game while Ben Hanson and Jeff Cork try their best to convince Dan Ryckert of the error of his ways. The conversation shifts from a debate between the superiority of Link to the Past or Link's Awakening to an overall discussion of the power of nostalgia within the Zelda series.

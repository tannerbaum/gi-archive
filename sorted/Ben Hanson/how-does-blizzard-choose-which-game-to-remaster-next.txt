  How Does Blizzard Choose Which Game To Remaster Next?






            While we've mainly been focusing on Warcraft III: Reforged with our exclusive month of features, with the video above we wanted to zoom out a bit and talk about one of the more interesting aspects of Blizzard these days: the relatively new classic games team. Last year the team released Starcraft: Remastered, in 2019 they'll be launching Warcraft III: Reforged, but what comes after that? While visiting the studio, we spoke with Warcraft III: Reforged lead environment artist Dave Berggren, lead producer Pete Stilwell, and lead designer Matt Morris about the team's subculture within Blizzard and their plans for the future.

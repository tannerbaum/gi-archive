  Behind The Scenes Of Darksiders II






We'd like you to meet the team behind Darksiders. The crafting of heaven, hell, and everything in between takes place in a relatively small studio based out of Austin, Texas called Vigil Games. With Tim Donley the development director of Darksiders II as your tour guide, we invite you to watch the video to get a better idea of what daily life is like in a game studio as well as catch a few sneak peeks at never before seen content from the game. Enjoy!

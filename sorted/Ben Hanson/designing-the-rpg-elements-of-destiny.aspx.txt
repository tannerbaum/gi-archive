  Designing The RPG Elements Of Destiny






Tyson Green's job is to keep you coming back to Destiny. As a designer with Bungie since the first Halo, Green worked his way through the ranks and became the multiplayer designer for Halo 3. Now serving as lead investment designer on Destiny, Green oversees everything from skill design to loot drops. While visiting the studio for January's cover story, we spoke with Green about how and why Bungie is now going all-in with progression. He has some interesting thoughts on how Destiny bucks common trends within the gaming industry and what the team has learned from games like Borderlands, Monster Hunter, and Dark Souls.
Watch the video below to learn all about progression, committing to skills, and the team's approach to loot in Destiny.

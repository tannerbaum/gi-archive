  GI Show – Gears 4, Paper Mario Debate, BioShock Game Club






It's another week here at Game Informer, and we have a mountain of exciting things to talk about. First off, Ben Hanson is joined by Ben Reeves and Kyle Hilliard to unload a ton of new, exclusive information on our new cover story South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Then Andrew Reiner talks about his surprising review of Gears of War 4 from The Coalition and why you should be excited to jump back into the world of Sera. On the other side of the fence, we have a overview of PlayStation VR and talk about whether or not Batman: Arkham VR and some other experiences are worth your money. Ben Reeves also shares his opinion on the new Paper Mario: Color Splash before things go off the rails. The back half of the show has Javy Gwaltney, Elise Favis, and Suriel Vazquez on hand to finish off our GI Game Club on the original BioShock.

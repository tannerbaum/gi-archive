  Return Of The Tombs: The Puzzles Of Rise Of The Tomb Raider






While visiting Crystal Dynamics for our extensive March cover story on Rise of the Tomb Raider, the development team emphasized that they were planning on responding to criticism of the last game by increasing the amount of large tombs for players to explore this time around. We sat down with creative director Noah Hughes to talk about the renewed emphasis on tombs and puzzles and how the design compares to the earlier classic Tomb Raider games.
Watch the interview below to learn more about how Crystal Dynamics is constructing physics-based puzzles that take advantage of the ancient spaces within Rise of the Tomb Raider.

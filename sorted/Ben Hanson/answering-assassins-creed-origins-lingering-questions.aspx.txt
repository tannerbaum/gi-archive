  Answering Assassin's Creed Origins' Lingering Questions






All month long we've been rolling out exclusive features covering Assassin's Creed Origins, and now we're ready to wrap things up with one final interview from game director Ashraf Ismail. He was kind enough to Skype in to The Game Informer Show podcast and answer dozens and dozens of burning questions from the community. So if you're looking for more info on the game's development, ambitious world, or even the details of the day/night cycle, then you're in luck. We hope you enjoy the conversation!

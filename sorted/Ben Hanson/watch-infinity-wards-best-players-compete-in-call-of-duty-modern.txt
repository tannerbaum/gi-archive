  Watch Infinity Ward's Best Players Compete In Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare's Gunfight






            If you listened to our conversation on The Game Informer Show podcast, then you know that our favorite multiplayer mode so far in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is Gunfight. We're continuing to roll out exclusive features on Infinity Ward's upcoming reboot, and the video above shows off a full high-level round of Gunfight featuring the best players from the studio. Check out the video above to see Justin, Ivan, and Giancarlo from QA alongside weapons specialist Ruy battle it out in this quick, 2v2 duel. If you like what you see, you can play the mode for free this weekend with the Alpha on the PlayStation 4.

  The Challenge Of Elder Scrolls Online: An Interview With The Creative Director






Paul Sage is working on his dream project. As a rabid fan of the Elder Scrolls series, Paul finally has a chance to help craft the land of Tamriel. The only downside is that every other fan of the series is eager to critique his work.

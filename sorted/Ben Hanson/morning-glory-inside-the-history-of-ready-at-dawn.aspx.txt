  Morning Glory: Inside The History Of Ready At Dawn






Founded by top-level talent formerly from Blizzard and Naughty Dog, Ready At Dawn has spent the last decade growing into one of the most talented studios in the industry. While visiting the Ready At Dawn for our cover story on its new game The Order: 1886, we sat down with co-founders Ru Weerasuriya and Andrea Pessino to get the full story behind the studio's rise. From the dark days of Daxter's excruciating development to the possibility of a 2D God of War, we hope fans enjoy this glimpse into the challenges of being an independent developer in an increasingly risky industry. Our thanks to Ready At Dawn for opening up their archives and supplying us with rare footage from the studio's history.
Watch the video below to learn how three ambitious developers went through the "terrifying" experience of growing a rogue studio from scratch.

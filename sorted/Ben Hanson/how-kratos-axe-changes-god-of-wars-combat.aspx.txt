  How Kratos' Axe Changes God Of War's Combat






In ourÂ new cover story on God of War, we share hands-on gameplay impressions of playing the new God of War. In this feature, we speak with lead gameplay designer Jason McDonald about the development and evolution of the new combat system. Removing Kratos' Blades of Chaos and replacing them with one axe is a risky move, and it took years of work before the team was happy with how it felt and played. McDonald has been working on the God of War series since the first game, and is open about the difficult task of changing things up.
Watch the video interview with McDonald below to learn about the role the axe plays in Santa Monica Studio's new vision for combat in God of War.

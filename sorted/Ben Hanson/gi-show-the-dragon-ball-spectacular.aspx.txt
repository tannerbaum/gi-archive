  GI Show – The Dragon Ball Spectacular






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this very fun episode, we dive deep into all things Dragon Ball in conjunction with our cover story on Dragon Ball FighterZ. If you've never watched the show or played a Dragon Ball game, we hope you'll still check out this episode as we explain what makes the gigantic Dragon Ball series so unique as a work of fiction. I'm joined by Kyle Hilliard, Suriel Vazquez, and Javy Gwaltney as we talk about Akira Toriyama's process of creating Dragon Ball, his work on games like Chrono Trigger, and what the ingredients are for the best Dragon Ball games. We're also joined by actors Kyle Hebert (the voice of Gohan, Ox King, the narrator) and Christopher R. Sabat (Vegeta, Yamcha, Piccolo) about the process of adding English voices to the games and the show. After all of that, we finally have a thorough conversation about the first three-ish seasons of Dragon Ball Super and how the show compares to Dragon Ball Z. We'll be back next week with a regular, new-game focused episode but we hope you enjoy this fun detour!

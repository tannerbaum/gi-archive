  How The Taken King Changes Destiny's Competitive Multiplayer






To coincide with ourÂ September cover story on Destiny: The Taken King, we've been rolling out features highlighting different aspects of the game in our content hub. While we've already showcased the eight new maps for the Crucible, we wanted to go a bit more in depth on the gameplay changes to the PvP aspect of Destiny: The Taken King. We sat down with design lead Lars Bakken to talk about the new modes that the team is adding, the current role of vehicles in the game, and how PvP content can tease the future of Destiny's PvE environments. Also, this video features new music from The Taken King so enjoy your first taste of what's to come!

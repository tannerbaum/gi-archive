  Take A Tour Of Randy Pitchford's Office






Randy Pitchford is a bit of a collector. His office is filled with odds and ends that vary from bobble-heads to a ColecoVision. He has an impressive collection of video game consoles and handhelds, so expect a full history lesson as he works his way down the line. There is also plenty of merchandise from Gearbox's games and a few insights into the kind of environment that Randy tries to uphold within the studio. Check out the video below to enter Randy's gaming cathedral.

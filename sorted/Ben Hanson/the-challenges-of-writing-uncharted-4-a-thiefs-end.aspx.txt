  The Challenges Of Writing Uncharted 4: A Thief's End






Coming off of the solitary writing duties on The Last of Us, creative director Neil Druckmann has some help this time around for Uncharted 4: A Thief's End with fellow writers Josh Scherr and Tom Bissell. Scherr has been in the animation department at Naughty Dog since the early days of the first Jak and Daxter (you can learn more about his work later in the month) and while he has worked extensively with the actors for previous entries, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End marks his debut as a writer for the studio. Tom Bissell is a game critic that has written books such as Extra Lives and helped with games such as Gears of War: Judgment and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, he is helping the Naughty Dog team put Uncharted 4 together as an external contractor. We spoke to Druckmann and Scherr about the difficulty of writing exposition scenes for the Uncharted series, the balance between Druckmann's darkness and Scherr's jokes, and how the team divides the work and tackles projects like this.

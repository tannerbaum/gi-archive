  Fall Of Cybertron: The New Optimus Prime






As the most iconic Transformer to ever roll out, High Moon Studios spent a lot of time rebuilding Optimus Prime from the ground up for Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. The war on Cybertron is coming to a dramatic climax, and Optimus has proven himself both a leader and a mighty warrior. His new look is battle-scarred, powered up, and ready for action. Check out the video to see the in-game model for Optimus Prime, complete with commentary from the High Moon team on creating a new look for the leader of the Autobots. Keep in mind that this footage is pre-alpha and was shot in a test area for the new game, so it does not represent the final appearance of the character. Enjoy!

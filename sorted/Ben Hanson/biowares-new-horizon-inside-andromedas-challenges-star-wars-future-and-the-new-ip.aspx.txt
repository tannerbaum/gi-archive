  BioWare's New Horizon: Andromeda, Star Wars, And The New IP






We're nearing the end of our month of coverage on BioWare's Mass Effect Andromeda. Before our hub of exclusive content covering the game, fans had a lot of questions about the next Mass Effect game and BioWare wasn't saying much. In this video interview with BioWare's general manager, Aaryn Flynn, we talk about the reasons behind the team's strategy of staying relatively quiet for years while developing Andromeda, and then branch into several other topics. If you're interested in learning more about what it's like behind the scenes of developing Mass Effect Andromeda, BioWare's new IP, or Star Wars: The Old Republic, then you'll have a lot to learn from Flynn.
Watch the video below to learn what lessons BioWare took from Shadow Realms' cancellation and why their future might include more Star Wars games and embracing co-op storytelling.

  Video Recap - Ubisoft's E3 Press Conference






To spare you an hour of executives reading scripts and Aisha Tyler trying her hardest to be entertaining, we wanted to share our gut-reaction impressions of Ubisoft's E3 2013 press conference. Game Informer's Kim Wallace and Kyle Hilliard were slightly underwhelmed, but  some interesting game announcements came form Ubisoft's big event. Watch the video below to see them share and discuss the highlights, which includes Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, The Crew, and The Division.

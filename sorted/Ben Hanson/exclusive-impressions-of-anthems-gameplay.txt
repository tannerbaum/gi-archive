  Exclusive Impressions Of Anthem's Gameplay






            Surprise! Game Informer's next cover story is Anthem from BioWare! Beyond what EA showed at the E3 press conference, Joe Juba and I know a lot about the game and have a lot to say. We visited BioWare in Edmonton to play the game and learn a mountain of information from the developers. This special edition podcast covers what we know about the game's story, what we think of the gameplay, and dozens more tiny details along the way. We also encourage you to read the full cover story by clicking here, we put the entire thing online just for you! We hope you enjoy the discussion, we'll have a lot more interviews with the game's developers to share once E3 quiets down.

  Miyamoto And Aonuma On Zelda's Balance Of Fan Feedback






With Game Informer's March cover story on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we took a deep dive into the mechanics and philosophy behind Link's next adventure. With today's video interview, we wanted to zoom out a bit speak with The Legend of Zelda's creator Shigeru Miyamoto and series producer Eiji Aonuma about the delicate balance of giving fans exactly what they want versus forging a new path and creating an unexpected gameplay experience. We talk about how the team is shifting away from elements of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and what details within Breath of the Wild best reflect their individual passions.
Watch the interview with Miyamoto and Aonuma below to learn more about Nintendo's philosophy toward focus testing and much more.

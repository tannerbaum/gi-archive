  What Middle-earth: Shadow Of Mordor Means For Monolith






Starting in 1997 with a game called Blood, Monolith Productions has focused on first-person experiences but has amassed an incredibly varied game catalogue. Everything from anime-inspired mech combat to bringing the world of The Matrix online, the path of Monolith Productions is unpredictable. Their next game, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, is bringing the studio in a bold new direction, putting a focus on player agency and third-person melee combat. I spoke with studio head Kevin Stephens and content director Matt Allen about the studio's prototype-filled road to Middle-earth.
Watch the video interview below to learn more about how the studio's past is informing Mordor's next-gen debut.

  Here's What to Expect from Alien: Isolation's First Eight Hours






Although our October issue and month of online content is a celebration of all horror games, we are focusing a lot of our attention on the promising Alien: Isolation and The Evil Within. Game Informer editor Jeff Cork played through the first seven chapters of Alien: Isolation on PS4 and wrote extensively about his experience in the new issue, but he also sat down with Alien fan Tim Turi on camera to talk about his lengthy hands-on impressions. They discuss the pros and cons of weapons in the game, what makes the game horrifying, and why the checkpoint system might prove to be divisive for players.
Watch the video preview below to see new gameplay from the beginning of the game and learn why you should keep your eye on Alien: Isolation.

  The Rise And Future Of Far Cry






While the series has been around for ten years, 2012's Far Cry 3 caught a lot of people by surprise and roped in plenty of new fans. While our cover story this month focuses on Far Cry 4, we wanted to speak with the developers about the bringing Far Cry back into the top tier of gaming releases. Executive producer Dan Hay and Far Cry 4's narrative director Mark Thompson were in the trenches together on the development of Far Cry 3 and helped the team turn it into one of the best games of the year. We spoke with them about the state of the Far Cry brand within Ubisoft and the conversations that helped steer the direction for Blood Dragon and the development of Far Cry 4.
Watch the video feature below to learn why they see themselves as the underdogs within Ubisoft and what they have in mind for the future of the Far Cry brand.

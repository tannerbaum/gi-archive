  Special Edition Podcast: Metal Gear Solid V






We hope you've enjoyed our March cover story on Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain and the month of exclusive content that we've been rolling out in our online hub, but we wanted to give the community a chance to ask any burning questions that we might have missed. We rounded up Metal Gear super-fan Joe Juba and the three editors that flew to Japan to speak with Hideo Kojima for the cover story Tim Turi, Dan Ryckert, and Ben Hanson to answer questions from our community about the upcoming games. We should warn you on a couple of fronts: this episode gets into some nitty-gritty details of Metal Gear lore and we do not spoil the end of Ground Zeroes.

Welcome to an info-packed episode of The Game Informer Show! On this week's episode, Ben Hanson is joined by Jeff Cork, Joe Juba, and Ben Reeves to talk about our trip to Arkane Studios to see and write a cover story about Prey. After that, we're joined by Suriel Vazquez as we discuss the high highs and low lows of Fumito Ueda's The Last Guardian. Then Jeff Marchiafava swings by to explain what makes Dead Rising 4 so much fun. After some great community emails, Andy McNamara, Andrew Reiner, and Suriel Vazquez talk about their hands-on time playing some exciting new games like the Crash Bandicoot remaster and we also talk about Andy's trip to Naughty Dog and experience hosting a panel on The Last of Us Part II.

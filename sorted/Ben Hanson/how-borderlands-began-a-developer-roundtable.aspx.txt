  How Borderlands Began: A Developer Roundtable






The concept behind the first Borderlands was brewing in the minds at Gearbox for quite some time before the four years of development even began. It was a game that was difficult to define, and the team behind it helped it grow from the phrase "shooter-looter" to a personality-drenched full-scale FPS-RPG love child. Now, two years after the game's release, executive producer Randy Pitchford, lead programmer Jimmy Sieben, lead level designer Graeme Timmins, and game designer Jonathan Hemingway share their stories and help explain what it took to get the game off the ground and onto store shelves. We really hope you enjoy this behind-the-scenes look at the first Borderlands -- let us know what you think of the video in the comments!

  Monolith Explains Changes To Tolkien's Lore In Shadow Of War






With each new detail that emerges about Middle-earth: Shadow of War, some fans question how the new game lines up with Tolkien's original vision of his world. While visiting Monolith Productions for our cover story on the game, Game Informer's biggest Tolkien fan and previews editor Matt Miller sat down with VP of creative Michael de Plater and narrative designer Tony Elias to discuss building the game's story and why they chose to add and tweak some details to the classical vision of Middle-earth.
Watch the video below to learn why they created a new ring of power, why Shelob the spider is a lady now, and much more.

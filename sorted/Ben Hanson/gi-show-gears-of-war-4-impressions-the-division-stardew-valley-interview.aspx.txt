  GI Show – Gears Of War 4 Impressions, The Division, Stardew Valley Interview






We have a heck of a show for you all this week. Host Ben Hanson is joined by Ben Reeves, Javy Gwaltney, and Matt Bertz to talk about the most exciting news this week in the gaming world. Not only do we have full impressions of The Division from Bertz, but Javy and Reeves are on hand to talk about our trip to The Coalition to see Gears of War 4. After all of that, we journey out to the farm and interview lone developer Eric Barone of the new Harvest Moon-inspired game Stardew Valley about the addicting game's insane four-year development and his plans for its future. We hope you enjoy the show!

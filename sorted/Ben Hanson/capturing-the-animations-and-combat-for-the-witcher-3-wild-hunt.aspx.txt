  Capturing The Animations And Combat For The Witcher 3






While visiting the studio for this month's cover story, CD Projekt RED was eager to show off its new in-house motion capture studio. While the main actors and cutscenes are recorded elsewhere, lead animator Tomasz Zawada is taking advantage of the new space and equipment to ensure that The Witcher 3 has a much larger library of animations than previous entries. With the help of master swordsman Maciej Kwiatkowski (from the stunt group called Stunt Forces), the space is also used to practice and capture Geralt's movements and all of the other combat animations for the game.

Watch the video below to learn how the team captures characters, monsters, and battles for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

It is worth noting that the model of Triss in the video is from The Witcher 2 and that the woman in the suit is not her actress, but just a volunteer from the studio.

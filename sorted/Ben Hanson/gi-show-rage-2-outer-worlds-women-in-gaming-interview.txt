  GI Show – Rage 2, Outer Worlds, Women In Gaming Interview






            Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this week's episode, we have Javy Gwaltney, Ben Reeves, and Leo Vader regaling us with details from their trip to Sweden to learn all about Avalanche's Rage 2 for our new cover story. Then Brian Shea and Jeff Cork join the show as we attempt to run down the highlights from The Game Awards, especially Far Cry New Dawn and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds. Dan Tack and Matt Miller are also eager to talk about Hades, the surprising new game from Supergiant Games. After some great community emails, we're joined by former Game Informer editor Meagan Marie to talk about her new book Women in Gaming: 100 Professionals of Play. We hope you enjoy the show!

  War Stories: How The Military Benefits From Call Of Duty






After a decade of digitizing combat, the team behind Call of Duty has spent a lot of time learning from the United States military. With the creation of the Call of Duty Endowment charity, Activision started giving back to the troops. We spoke with Activision Publishing's CEO Eric Hirshberg and Infinity Ward's executive producer Mark Rubin about this program and how the team learns from and gives back to the military. You can visit the official site to learn more about the Call of Duty Endowment program.
Watch the video below to learn about the relationship between Call of Duty and the military and why the game is so far from reality.

  Exclusive Gameplay Guides For Dragon Ball FighterZ's Newest Characters






While visiting developer Arc System Works for our new cover story on Dragon Ball FighterZ, we wanted to let the team share some tips and just generally show off some of the work they've put into the new characters. We spoke to the game's lead battle planner (and 14-year ArcSys veteran) Seiji Fukumoto through the game's director Junya Motomura translating for us and got the rundown on the characters of Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Vegeta, Yamcha, and Tien. We should point out that some of the names for moves used in the video are in Japanese, sorry for any confusion but it's their game and all.
Watch the video below to learn all about how Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku plays.

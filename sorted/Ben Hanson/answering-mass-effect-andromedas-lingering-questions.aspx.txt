  Answering Mass Effect Andromeda's Lingering Questions






While we've moved on to highlight Prey from Arkane Studios, we wanted to officially close out our month of coverage on Mass Effect Andromeda with a special edition of The Game Informer Show podcast where we talk with Mass Effect Andromeda's creative director Mac Walters via Skype and ask him dozens of direct questions from the community. We hope you've enjoyed our month of exclusive features and that this podcast answers some of your small, burning questions about BioWare's next RPG.

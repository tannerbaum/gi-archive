  Special Edition Podcast: Evolve






We're nearing the end of our month of exclusive coverage of Evolve, the next game from the developers of Left 4 Dead. With all of the information that we've released on the game so far, we wanted to give our community a chance to fill any gaps and ask one of the game's developers for more information. On this special edition of the podcast, we are joined by the co-founder of Turtle Rock Studios 2.0 and Evolve's lead designer, Chris Ashton. Listen to the podcast below or subscribe on iTunes to learn more about the variety of monsters in the game, how the game is more than just one multiplayer-only mode, and when you can expect to see gameplay footage. Also, we should point out that the music in the podcast is not from the game but from local musician Sam Keenan.

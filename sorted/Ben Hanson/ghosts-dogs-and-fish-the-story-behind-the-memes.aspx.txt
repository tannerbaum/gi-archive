  Ghosts, Dogs, And Fish: The Story Behind The Memes






One of the most unexpected side-effects of Activision and Infinity Ward promoting this year's Call of Duty game is the popularity of an in-game dog named Riley and the importance of fish AI. Starting with the debut making-of trailer at the Xbox One reveal event, the internet latched on to the absurdity and charm of a dog being a member of your squad in Call of Duty: Ghosts. Bets were soon placed on the odds of that dog surviving throughout a game that aims to create a more "emotional" experience for the player. While visiting the studio, we spoke with Infinity Ward's executive producer Mark Rubin about the story behind the memes from the studio's point of view. 
Will Riley live or die? Will the fish get out of the way? Watch the video below to find out.

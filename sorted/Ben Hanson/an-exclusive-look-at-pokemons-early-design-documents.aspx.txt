  An Exclusive Look At Pokémon's Early Design Documents






With our recent trip to Game Freak's studio in Tokyo, we spoke to the team about their earliest projects and the origins of the Pokémon series. But why just tell when you can show? We were honored and delighted that Pokémon series producer, director, and composer Junichi Masuda and the director of Pokémon Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori dug up their oldest documents and sketches from the development of the entire Pokémon series to help explain the team's process of bringing the handheld series to life.
Watch the video below for never-before-seen insight into the full design process behind Game Freak's Pokémon series.

  Uncovering The Secrets Of Max Payne And Alan Wake In Remedy's Warehouse






While visiting Finland for our December cover story on Remedy Entertainment's Quantum Break, we wanted to touch not only on the studio's future but also reflect on their past work developing games like Max Payne and Alan Wake. The Remedy team dedicates a room in their office as their "development warehouse" where they store physical relics and odds and ends from the studio's history. Art director Saku Lehtinen was kind enough to lead our cameras through the warehouse as he dug through the boxes and uncovered secrets from the past, including Max Payne's research photographs and Alan Wake's wardrobe from the proposed sequel.
Watch the video tour below to get an exclusive look into the past of one of the industry's oldest independent studios.Â

  The Future Of Strategy Games: An Interview With Sid Meier






While Sid Meier is not directly designing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, a trip to Firaxis Games wouldn't be complete without a conversation about strategy games with the legendary game designer. Game Informer's Adam Biessener has been a rabid fan of the Civilization series for years, so the conversation floats from the past to the future of Civilization while noting the impact that the fans have had on the series. We also took this opportunity to pick Sid Meier's mind about the state of the strategy genre and how it manages to stay relevant in a shooter-drenched marketplace. Check out the video below and leave your feedback in the comments. Enjoy!

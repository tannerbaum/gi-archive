  Infinity Ward Answers Your Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare Questions






Throughout the month, we've been rolling out exclusive features on Infinity Ward's upcoming Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare to go along with our recent cover story. To cap off the month, we pulled together dozens and dozens of the community's burning questions about the game and will be asking Infinity Ward's studio art director Brian Horton and design director Jacob Minkoff the best ones in this special edition of the podcast. Check out the podcast to learn more about the game's linearity (or lack there-of), comparisons to Wing Commander, and how the team reacts to online criticism.

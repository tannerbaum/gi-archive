  David Cage, Metal Gear Solid 4's Producer, And Shenmue's Director Talk Storytelling






Listening to Camouflaj Radio, the podcast that chronicles the development of the game Republique, is a great way to learn about the challenge of game development and the struggle for a game to tell a coherent story. The game's director Ryan Payton was the assistant producer on Metal Gear Solid 4 and the original creative director for Halo 4 before he left Microsoft to found Camouflaj and begin development on Republique, the stealth game coming to iOS and PC. Payton is also a fan of David Cage and his work at Quantic Dream, specifically Heavy Rain. At E3 2013, I arranged a one-on-one video with Ryan Payton and David Cage to talk about Quantic Dream's next project Beyond: Two Souls and the pitfalls of storytelling in an interactive medium.
Watch the video below to hear the two discuss Beyond: Two Souls, making Metal Gear Solid more approachable, and the struggle to tell a good story in Halo 4. Be sure to stick around until the 22:00 minute mark for the surprise appearance of a very special guest.

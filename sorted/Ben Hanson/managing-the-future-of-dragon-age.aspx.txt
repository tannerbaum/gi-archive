  Managing The Future Of Dragon Age






This is a bonus video. Dragon Age's creative director Mike Laidlaw has appeared in other videos throughout our month of coverage on Dragon Age: Inquisition, but some topics covered in the interview didn't fit into any of the other video features. We thought that fans would appreciate hearing his current thoughts on the lore of the series and the studio's plans for the future.
Watch the video below to hear Laidlaw discuss story accessibility, how Dragon Age compares to Game of Thrones, making the conflicts potentially last forever, and the art of tying up loose ends.

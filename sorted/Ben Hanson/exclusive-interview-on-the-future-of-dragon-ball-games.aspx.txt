  Exclusive Interview On The Future Of Dragon Ball Games






With our new cover story on Dragon Ball FighterZ, we've shown a lot of new gameplay and focused a lot on the game's developer, Arc System Works. With this video interview, we wanted to zoom out and discuss the process of creating Dragon Ball games in general and what the future path looks like for publisher Bandai Namco. We spoke with producer Ryo Mito, who goes back to producing games like Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi, and Dragon Ball Xenoverse's producer Masayuki Hirano at Bandai Namco's headquarters in Tokyo.
Watch the interview below to learn how they choose the right development studio, genre, and vision to successfully carry the Dragon Ball license into the future.

  GI Show – God Of War, Top 10 Games From 2017






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this week's episode, we talk all about our new cover story on God of War. Joe Juba and Ben Hanson spent a couple of days at Sony's studio in Santa Monica and have a lot of thoughts to share on the game's new direction. After some great emails and a lot of fun discussion about crafting the magazine's Top 50 games of 2017 list, we bring in Leo Vader and Dan Tack and the four of us go around the table to share our personal top 10 lists of great games from 2017.

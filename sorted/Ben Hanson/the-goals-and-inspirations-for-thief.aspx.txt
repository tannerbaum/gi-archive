  The Goals And Inspirations For Thief






When rebooting a franchise, the developers can't help but look outside the original games for inspiration. While the team at Eidos Montreal is confident that they understand why the older Thief games are held in such high regard and are bringing those elements to the new game, the long production cycle for this game has given them plenty of time to comb through other media. From excellent stealth games like Mark of the Ninja to atmospheric titles like The Room on iOS, the team cited a wide range of influences.
Watch the video below to hear Thief's director Nicolas Cantin and producer Stephane Roy explain who the new game is for and how games like Assassin's Creed, Bioshock, and Dishonored have helped shape it along the way.

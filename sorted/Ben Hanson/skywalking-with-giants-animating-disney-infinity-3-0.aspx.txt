  Skywalking With Giants: Animating Disney Infinity






While visiting Avalanche Software for our June cover story on Disney Infinity 3.0, we met up with the studio's animation department head Gavan Knowlton to talk about the animation team's work for the new game. With development taking place all over the globe from developers like Ninja Theory, Knowlton oversees the process and makes sure that the game's animations align with their respective films. We spoke with Knowlton about the research process behind working with these classic characters, the team's biggest animation blunder, and what happens when you give Anna from Frozen Darth Maul's walking animation.
Watch the video below to see more of Disney Infinity 3.0 and the Star Wars characters in action and what Disneyland ride will be making a surprise appearance in the game.

  What Is Evolve?






Yesterday we revealed February's cover story, a new IP from the creators of Left 4 Dead called Evolve. With this first feature for the month, we wanted to explain why Evolve is much more than just "Left 4 Aliens." While visiting Turtle Rock Studios we spoke with studio heads Phil Robb and Chris Ashton about the concept of their new game. The video below covers how Evolve is different than Left 4 Dead, how it compares to Monster Hunter, and whether or not you can play single-player. To learn much more about Evolve, check out the latest issue of Game Informer for the full cover story.
Watch the video below to learn what it's like to play Evolve and why you should keep your eye on this bold new multiplayer experience.

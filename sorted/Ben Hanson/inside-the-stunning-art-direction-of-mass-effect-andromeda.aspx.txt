  Inside Mass Effect Andromeda's Stunning Art Direction






While a lot of the features we've been rolling out this month to go alongside our cover story on BioWare's Mass Effect Andromeda have focused on characters or gameplay, there's plenty more to discuss with the game's art direction. We've focused in on the design of the alien race called the Kett in an earlier video, but Mass Effect Andromeda's art director Joel MacMillan had a lot more to say about the art in the new game. Not only is the team at BioWare Montreal consulting with the Mass Effect trilogy's art director Derek Watts, but they also brought in vehicle designer Daniel Simon. You might recognize Simon's work from films such as Oblivion or Tron: Legacy.
Watch the video below to learn from MacMillan how these two artists are helping to shape the vision of Mass Effect Andromeda.

  Why Guerrilla Needed Horizon Zero Dawn To Be An RPG






We're continuing to roll out exclusive features covering Horizon Zero Dawn from Guerrilla Games all month long in our hub. Today's update looks to clear up a question some fans of the studio might have: why an RPG? Guerrilla Games is well-known for the first-person shooter Killzone series, so why make the jump over to an open-world action-RPG? We spoke with the game's director Mathijs de Jonge about the benefits of the genre and the pitfalls found in other RPGs that they were looking to avoid. If you're interested in learning more, check out our video feature on the challenging development history of the game or on the depth of gameplay.
Watch the interview below to see new gameplay from Horizon Zero Dawn and learn how the game might compare to Capcom's Monster Hunter.

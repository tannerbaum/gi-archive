Battlefield 3 is not a simple rehash. DICE has spent years building the new technology to ensure that the third entry in the series stands apart from the rest. In these three interviews, we speak with the team to learn how the new technology will affect each player's experience on the battlefield. Check out the first video to learn all about the greatly enhanced destructive capabilities of the Frostbite 2 engine.

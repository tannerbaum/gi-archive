  Microsoft's Long Game: Inside Quantum Break's Challenging Development






We've shared our hands-on impressions of Quantum Break's gameplay, but now we want to reverse time a bit and talk about how the game came to be. While visiting Remedy Entertainment's studio in Espoo, Finland for our December cover story, we spoke with the team about how Quantum Break evolved from an idea in Alan Wake into a full-blown Microsoft exclusive. 
Creative director Sam Lake, game director Mikael Kasurinen, and narrative designer Greg Louden share details on the creation of the television show and why the game's development has taken such a long time.
Watch the video below to see new footage from Quantum Break and learn how the game evolved alongside Microsoft's shifting focus with the Xbox One.

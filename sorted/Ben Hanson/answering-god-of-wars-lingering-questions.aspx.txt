  Answering God Of War's Lingering Questions






All month long we've been rolling out features on God of War for the PlayStation 4, and we went in-depth on our time playing the game in the magazine's cover story. To close things out for the month, we opened the doors and had the community ask questions for the game's creative director Cory Barlog to answer. Some questions submitted have been answered elsewhere in our month of coverage, and some would clearly prompt spoilers, but thanks to everybody that submitted questions. We hope you enjoy the answers!

You can watch the interview with Barlog below, subscribe and listen to the audio on iTunes or Google Play, or listen on SoundCloud.

  GI Show – Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Nier, Zelda Roundtable






Welcome back to another episode of The Game Informer Show! On this week's podcast, Kimberley Wallace Elise Favis share new impressions of visiting Naughty Dog and checking out Uncharted: The Lost Legacy for our new cover story. Then we're joined by Javy Gwaltney to break down Middle-earth: Shadow of War and the rest of GDC 2017 experience. After that, Brian Shea explains the Nintendo Switch's Super Bomberman R and Joe Juba tells us why Nier: Automata is worth a look. After some great community emails, we have a six-person roundtable to discuss the first few hours of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We swap stories of our unique experiences in the beginning of the game and see how each of us fared with the various puzzles.

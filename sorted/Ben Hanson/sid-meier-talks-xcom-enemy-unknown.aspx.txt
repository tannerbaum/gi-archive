The gaming industry legend serves as the director of creative development at Firaxis Games and the XCOM team treats him as the holy man to consult on top of the mountain. We spoke to Sid Meier about his history with X-COM, who the game is for, and what will make XCOM: Enemy Unknown feel at home in the Firaxis library. Check out the video below to learn more.

  The Inspirations For Halo 4






Halo 4 will be the first new entry in the series from the freshly-formed studio 343 Industries, but that doesn't mean that the team is approaching the game from a blank slate. Each team member was inspired to join the team and work on the game for their own reasons; inspirations for the new game come from anywhere and everywhere. FromÂ a love for Halo: Combat Evolved's co-op, the original Star Wars trilogy, or even real-world science (for more on this topic check out this bonus video), watch the video below to learn more about where 343 Industries is finding the inspiration for their work on Halo 4.

  GI Show – Forza Horizon 4, The End Of Telltale, Spider-Man Game Club Part 3






            Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this episode, Ben Hanson, Andrew Reiner, Matt Miller, and Ben Reeves talk about the glowing review for Microsoft's Forza Horizon 4. Elise Favis and Kimberley Wallace then join the show to talk about playing the first episode of Life is Strange 2 and then we talk about the sad and surprising closure of Telltales Games and the ambiguous end for The Walking Dead. The Tokyo Game Show is over and done with, and we have Kimberley Wallace to talk about the stand-out games like Devil May Cry 5 and Death Stranding. After some great community emails, we finish off our spoiler-filled discussion of Insomniac's Spider-Man's third and final act with the GI Game Club.

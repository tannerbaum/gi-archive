  History Lessons: The Road From Assassin's Creed III To Far Cry 4






Back in early 2012, we spoke with creative director Alex Hutchinson about his hopes and plans for wrapping up Assassin's Creed III. Once the game shipped, Hutchinson moved away from the Assassin's Creed team within Ubisoft Montreal to be the creative director for Far Cry 4. While visiting the studio for our cover story on Far Cry 4, we spoke with Hutchinson about Assassin's Creed III in retrospect. He has a lot of thoughts on what he's espeicailly proud of, changes he'd like to make, and the bug-filled cost of such an ambitious project.
Watch the video interview below to hear Hutchinson's thoughts on the successes and failures of Assassin's Creed III, how he ended up working on Far Cry 4, and whether or not his future could involve another entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise.

  The Secret History of Volition






What started out as a simple interview about a studio evolved into this: an hour-long documentary about the 18-year history of Volition, Inc. The studio provided an unprecedented amount of never-before-seen concept art and early footage of their great games, even from a couple that were canceled before their release. The video covers a lot of ground. We recommend starting from the beginning to get a full look at not only the history of Volition, but how far the gaming industry has come in 18 short years. Â Let us know what you think, and thanks for watching.

  Playing Spider-Man In Lego Marvel Super Heroes






Choosing to branch out from the Marvel film universe and include the entire brand's cast of characters in Lego Marvel Super Heroes was a bold move for TT Games. Arguably the biggest question was what to do with a Lego version of Spider-Man. The team at Traveller's Tales decided to embrace the challenge and create a version of the classic character that has the full maneuverability and web-slinging options that we'd expect when exploring the open-world version of Lego New York City.
Watch the video below to hear the game director Arthur Parsons talk about the development challenge and discuss the possibility of a Stan Lee cameo.

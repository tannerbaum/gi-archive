  How Lego's Adapting Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Most Devastating Scene






One of the most consistent things about the Lego games from TT Games is the comedy. The developers in England have become masters of creating funny games, whether they're original stories or gag-filled film adaptations.

The duo break down their working relationship with Lego and Lucasfilm and also explain why certain scenes in the film were especially difficult to Lego-fy.
Watch the interview below to learn about the writing process for the Lego games and how they are handling that one scene.

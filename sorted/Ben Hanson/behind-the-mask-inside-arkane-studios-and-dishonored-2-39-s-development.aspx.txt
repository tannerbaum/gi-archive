  Behind The Mask: Inside Dishonored 2's Development






Arkane Studios has been around for 17 years, releasing successful games and plugging away on secret projects, but it was the release of 2012's Dishonored that introduced the talented studio to a wide, new audience. With our June cover story on Dishonored 2, we've been rolling out information on the gameplay and art of the new game but wanted to also focus on the team behind the sequel. There's been a little bit of confusion about the current state of Arkane Studios, with Dishonored's co-creative director Harvey Smith moving to France to lead development on Dishonored 2, so we spoke with Smith about the reasons behind the move and how this project has evolved.
Watch the video below to learn more about the development history of Dishonored 2 and how the team compares to the first game's lead developers.

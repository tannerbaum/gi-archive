  The Return Of Races In Dragon Age: Inquisition






One of the most beloved aspects of Dragon Age: Origins was the option to select your race. Choosing between a human, dwarf, or elf (and playing through their various origin stories) personalized each player's experience in the world of Thedas. The absence of racial choices in Dragon Age 2 was a sore point with fans. During our studio visit, BioWare was proud to announce that Dragon Age: Inquisition brings the feature back â€“ contrary to its previous claims that players would once again be human-only.

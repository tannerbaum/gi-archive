  51 Questions And Answers About The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild






Despite The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild being weeks away from a release, we still have a lot of questions about Link's next adventure. The answers that we couldn't fit in our extensive March cover story on the game were saved for this rapid-fire video interview with The Legend of Zelda's creator Shigeru Miyamoto and series producer Eiji Aonuma. Game Informer's Ben Reeves sat down with these legendary Nintendo developers to pick their brain about Breath of the Wild's gameplay, Zelda lore, and much more. If you enjoy this feature, remember we have plenty more videos (including new gameplay) and interviews rolling out throughout the month in our hub of exclusive content on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Watch the video interview below to learn more than you ever imagined about Miyamoto, Tingle, and New Donk City.

  A Video Guide To Gears of War: Judgment's OverRun Mode






We had a rare treat while visiting Epic Games for this month's cover story: we were able to play several hours of Gears of War: Judgment's OverRun mode. Combining the best parts of Beast and Horde mode from previous installments, OverRun pits class-based human forces against a variety of player-controlled Locust. After a particularly heated match, Game Informer's Dan Ryckert and Tim Turi sat down with the lead multiplayer designer Quinn DelHoyo to talk about what went right, wrong, and some advanced strategies for the future. Watch the video below to learn about the new mode from the developer that knows it best and to see Gears of War: Judgment in action.

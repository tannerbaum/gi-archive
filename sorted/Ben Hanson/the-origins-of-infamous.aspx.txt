  The Origins Of Infamous






Amidst our coverage of the upcoming Infamous Second Son, we thought that it would be interesting to look back on the creation of the original game in the ongoing series. As a stand-out new IP on the Playstation 3 and a studio-changing game for the talented team at Sucker Punch Productions, Infamous' three years of development is a lot to cover in one video. The team shed light on their other pitches to Sony after they finished the Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves (one of which has a familiar name), the challenges of development, and what the studio learned from its release.
Watch the video below to learn from studio co-founder Brian Fleming and game director Nate Fox about the spark behind the Infamous franchise.

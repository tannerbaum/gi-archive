  Five Ways Rise Of The Tomb Raider Improves Upon The Reboot






We're very excited to roll out a month of exclusive content for Rise of the Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics to go along with our extensive March cover story. The 2013 reboot really impressed us and we were curious about how the development team is looking to improve on that experience. While visiting the studio, we spoke to the creative director for the Tomb Raider franchise Noah Hughes about the feedback they received on the reboot and the key areas they're hoping to improve for the next entry.
Watch the video below to learn more about what they're changing and hoping to enhance for Lara's next big adventure.

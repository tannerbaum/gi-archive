  Exploring The World Of Dragon Age: Inquisition






With Dragon Age: Inquisition, Bioware has looked back to its roots and is emphasizing player agency and exploration in the world of Thedas. The lead developers were proud to show off the new, larger regions that they've built for players to explore on foot and while mounted. Lead world designer Keith Warner was gracious enough to let us film his monitor as he explained the process for building and testing the world of Inquisition.  Creative director Mike Laidlaw had some interesting thoughts on the problems with narrative in an open-world game, so stay tuned to the end of the video to hear him discuss whether or not this is a stepping stone for a fully open-world Dragon Age game.
Watch the video below to see more Dragon Age: Inquisition in action and to learn about the massive regions that you'll be exploring next year.

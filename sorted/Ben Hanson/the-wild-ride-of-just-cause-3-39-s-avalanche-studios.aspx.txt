  The Highs, Lows, And Future Of Just Cause's Avalanche Studios






When we visited New York City for the December cover story on Just Cause 3, we were able to sit down with the co-founder of Avalanche Studios Christofer Sundberg. Flying over from the headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, Sundberg tries to visit the New York branch of the studio every month to keep up on the development of Just Cause 3 and make the trans-atlantic studio feel more unified. Primarily known for the Just Cause series, Avalanche Studios has also created games like the free-to-play TheHunter, the downloadable Renegade Ops, and the studio in Stockholm is currently working on Mad Max. I spoke with Sundberg about the difficulty of maintaining team morale during low points in their history, cancelled games from their past (including a rumored Iron Man game from 2012), and their interest level in working on an established Square Enix property like Final Fantasy.
Watch the video interview with the co-founder of Avalanche Studios below to learn the highs and lows of the studio's history and why their future might contain more self-published games.

  Here's Why Nintendo Land Deserves A Second Look






Minigame collections get a bad rap in the gaming industry, so people were quick to dismiss Nintendo Land when it was unveiled for the Wii U at E3 2012. As more games have been announced and more people have had a chance to play it, the tide is slowly turning in the theme park's favor. Containing twelve games that are based on Nintendo franchises such as Metroid, Pikmin, and Balloon Fight, Nintendo Land will be packaged with the deluxe Wii U console for the United States. Game Informer editors Tim Turi and Dan Ryckert experienced what the title has to offer when they visited Nintendo's headquarters for the Mario cover story. Watch the video below to hear their hands-on impressions and to get a look at exclusive footage for Metroid's co-op mission mode.

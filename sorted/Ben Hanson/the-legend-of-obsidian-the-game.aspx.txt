  The Legend Of Obsidian: The Game






When embarking on the trip to Obsidian Entertainment, we never could have guessed that we'd actually be getting two exclusive game reveals. Upon entering the studio, our eyes were immediately drawn to the modest arcade cabinet sitting in the dining area. From the mind of South Park: The Game programmer Dan Rubalcaba, we are proud to show you gameplay footage of Obsidian: The Game. A dungeon-crawler based on the founders of the studio, Obsidian: The Game is a simple yet addicting experience that can only be found within the Obsidian Entertainment studio. Watch the video below to learn more.

  BioWare Wants To Make Small, Experimental Games






            Our latest cover story is about Anthem, and that game is currently BioWare's primary focus. However, the studio is also considering projects beyond Anthem's release. While visiting the studio in Edmonton, we spoke with BioWare's general manager Casey Hudson and executive producer Mark Darrah about the team's desire to release smaller, more experimental games that are "true to the corest parts of our core". 

Watch the video below to learn more about how the team is inspired by short filmes and games like Rockstar's Table Tennis.

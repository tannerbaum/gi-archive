  Ted Price Discusses The Evolution Of Fuse And Fan Feedback






You might remember seeing a trailer for a game called Overstrike at EA's press conference over a year ago, but the team at Insomniac Games remained quiet about the mysterious title until last month. The game has been renamed Fuse and leaves the campy 70s vibe on display in the original trailer behind for a more "realistic" and darker tone.
While visiting the studio for our cover story, I sat down with CEO Ted Price to talk about the original idea for the game, what makes the co-op unique, and what fans have been saying about the change in direction.

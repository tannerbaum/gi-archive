  Exclusive Gameplay Of A Nazgul Boss Fight In Middle-earth: Shadow Of War






With our new October cover story on Middle-earth: Shadow of War, we're offering a broad overlook at the upcoming game from Monolith Productions and an exclusive deep dive into several new aspects. One of the new, exciting things we'll be talking about throughout the month is the studio's fresh take on the Nazgul. The nine ring wraiths you might remember from the films are sprinkled throughout the game as boss fights, and defeating them reveals how the men became these immortal spirits.
Watch the gameplay video below with the VP of creative Michael de Plater walking us through the boss fight with the Nazgul named Helm Hammerhand.

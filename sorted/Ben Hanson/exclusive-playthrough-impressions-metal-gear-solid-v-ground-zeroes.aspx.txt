  Our Exclusive MGS V: Ground Zeroes Playthrough Impressions






You might be confused about Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. First there was the reveal that didn't label it as the fifth entry in the main series, then there was the confusing rollout of The Phantom Pain, and now you might have heard some secondhand accounts about the length or quality of the game. We're here to set the record straight with our direct, hands-on impressions of Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes. As part of our cover story, Game Informer's Tim Turi and Dan Ryckert flew to Japan and spent several hours with the game. They've finished the main story mission and a couple of the side missions and were eager to talk about their experience. They cover a lot of ground in the video and it even contains some gameplay tips from Hideo Kojima himself. You can learn much more about Ground Zeroes, The Phantom Pain, and the life and mind of Hideo Kojima by reading our extensive cover story this month.

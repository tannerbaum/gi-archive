  Monster Hunting In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt






As the protagonist of The Witcher series, one of Geralt of Rivia's defining characteristics is also his profession: monster hunting. While the team at CD Projekt RED touch on this mechanic in past entries, tracking and killing creatures for a bounty is one of the pillars of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

Watch the video below to hear gameplay designers Maciej Szczesnik and Marvin So explain how the new system will work and why they think it will help immerse players in Geralt's world.

  Answering Black Ops 4/Blackout's Lingering Questions






            All month long, we've hopefully been answering your questions about Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 with our new cover story. With our final exclusive feature on the game, we've turned the reins over to the community and you all provided hundreds of great questions for Treyarch's design director David Vonderhaar to answer. On this special edition episode of The Game Informer Show, we Skyped in Vonderhaar and got as many answers as we could about Blackout and much, much more.

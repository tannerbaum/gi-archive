  The Story Behind The Last Of Us Debut Trailer






At this point I think it's safe to assume that you've seen the debut trailer for Naughty Dog's The Last of Us. While visiting the studio we took the opportunity to ask the game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann about the creation of the video and what it is like to have your top-secret project revealed before the world. Check out the video below to hear their side of the story and to see footage from two early versions of the trailer.

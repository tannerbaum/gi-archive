  Life After Death: The Story Of Turtle Rock Studios






To finish off our month of coverage of Evolve, we wanted to take an exhaustive look at the complete history of the game's developer, Turtle Rock Studios. Studio heads Chris Ashton and Phil Robb have had long careers in the game industry, contributing to classics like Command & Conquer, Counter-Strike, and of course Left 4 Dead. While the studio was originally founded by Mike Booth, who is currently heading up a mysterious project at Blizzard, Ashton and Robb have seen the studio through several resurrections.
Watch the video below to get the inside story on how Left 4 Dead was created, the fall of THQ, and the creation of Evolve.

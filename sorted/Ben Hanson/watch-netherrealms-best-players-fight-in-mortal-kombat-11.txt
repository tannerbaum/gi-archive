Now we're unearthing old wounds by having Brownback unleash his full potential and fight against his old rivalÂ Ken Morris (certification analyst for NetherRealm Studios) in Mortal Kombat 11. Learn about the rivalry and watch a full match between NetherRealm's two best players Brownback (Jade) and Morris (Kano) above. Also, yes, they prefer to play with controllers.

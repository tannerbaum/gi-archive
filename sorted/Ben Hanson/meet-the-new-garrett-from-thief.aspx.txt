Redesigning a classic character is an incredibly difficult challenge. Stay too close to the original and the design seems antiquated and maybe even boring, while straying too far will alienate your most passionate fan-base. Thief's game director Nicolas Cantin was heavily involved in the redesign of the game's protagonist and pulled from his previous work designing the character of Altair for the Assassin's Creed series. Beyond the look of Garrett, narrative director Steven Gallagher describes his inspiration for the character's complex personality.

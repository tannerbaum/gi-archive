  Getting Up Again: The Birth Of Respawn And Titanfall






Vince Zampella and Jason West developed the most successful franchise of the generation, then they were fired. The creators of Call of Duty founded a new studio called Respawn Entertainment, signed a publishing deal with Electronic Arts, and were given carte blanche to create a new IP. 
We visited the studio for this month's cover storyÂ and talked with the team about the long and painful process of building a new game, and Respawn also granted us access to concept art and studio photographs from the earliest days of Titanfall.
Watch the video feature below to learn how the team started in an office without electricity and ended up creating our game of the show for E3 2013.

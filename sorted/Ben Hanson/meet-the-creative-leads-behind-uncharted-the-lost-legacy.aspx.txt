  Meet The Creative Leads Behind Uncharted: The Lost Legacy






Since its founding, Naughty Dog has tackled massive creative projects through the guidance of key development partnerships. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy leaves Nathan Drake behind in favor of Chloe. Naughty Dog has also shaken things up internally by elevating Shaun Escayg to the role of creative director and Kurt Margenau to game director. In this video feature, we speak to Naughty Dog's president Evan Wells and The Last of Us Part II's director Neil Druckmann about working with Escayg and Margenau, and what makes the two of them a potent fit to lead development on this new take for Uncharted. 
Watch the video below to learn about the importance of healthy working relationships in the development of a project like Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.

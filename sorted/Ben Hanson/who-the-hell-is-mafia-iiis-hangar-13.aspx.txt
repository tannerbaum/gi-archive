  Who The Hell Is Mafia III Developer Hangar 13?






With our November cover story on Mafia III, we gave readers a mountain of information on the game. After a shift away from Mafia II's creators 2K Czech (which now serves a support role in development), there are a lot of questions from fans about where Hangar 13 came from and how they plan on continuing the Mafia franchise. In this video feature, we peel back the curtain on the new studio that's working to create it.  
While visiting the studio, we spoke with the studio head Haden Blackman and executive producer Andy Wilson about the origin of Hangar 13, the best way to build of a new development team, what's up with their weird cat logo, and more. Watch the video feature below to learn about the challenges and thrills of creating a new AAA studio from scratch.

  Special Edition Podcast: No Man's Sky






To coincide with our January cover story on the ambitious No Man's Sky from Hello Games, we've been rolling out features all month in our content hub. We've covered a lot of ground, but there's still an infinite number of questions that you can ask the team at Hello Games about the infinite universe that they're creating. To help with this task,Â we turned to our community and chose the questions that have not been answered anywhere else in our coverage. On this special edition podcast we're joined by the founder of Hello Games Sean Murray and we barrage him with your questions. Hopefully, you learn something new about the game.
Listen to the podcast below to learn even more about No Man's Sky before its release next year.

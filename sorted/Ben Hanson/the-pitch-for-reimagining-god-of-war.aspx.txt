  The Pitch For Reimagining God Of War






With our new cover story on God of War for the PlayStation 4, we go into details about the journey of Kratos and Atreus. However, with this video interview, we want to focus on the development team at Santa Monica Studio and specifically on the decisions of creative director Cory Barlog and studio head Shannon Studstill. While visiting the studio, we spoke with Barlog and Studstill about reimagining God of War and how much they were willing to change up the classic formula in order to breathe new life into the series.
Watch the video below to learn other mythologies the team might want to explore in the future, why they didn't make an open-world game, and much more.

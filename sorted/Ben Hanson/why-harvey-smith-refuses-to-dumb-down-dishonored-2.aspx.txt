  Why Harvey Smith Refuses To 'Dumb Down' Dishonored 2






It's a nebulous genre, but Arkane Studios and Dishonored 2's creative director Harvey Smith have an undying passion for "immersive first-person" games. With our June cover story detailing Dishonored 2, we break down what's exciting about the sequel's gameplay, and while visiting the studio we spoke to Smith about the game's place within the evolving genre. We discuss the importance of voicing the protagonists this time around, how much attention the developers can demand from players, and the impact that Smith hopes the game has on the industry. If you want to ask Harvey Smith something about his career or Dishonored 1 or 2, head here to leave your comment and we'll ask him on an upcoming podcast.

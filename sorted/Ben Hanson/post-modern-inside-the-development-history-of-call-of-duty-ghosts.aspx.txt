  Post-Modern: Inside The Development History Of Call Of Duty: Ghosts






With Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 tied up in a relatively neat package, the team at Infinity Ward began the long trek of developing a brand new entry in the series. We visited the studio for this month's cover story and spoke with executive producer Mark Rubin about the history of the game that eventually became Call of Duty: Ghosts. What started out as a few notecards about dogs and the apocalypse is now months away from a gigantic release and we hope that the video feature will help explain the process. You may have been confused about the recent story trailer that shows astronauts with guns, so Rubin also adds some more context of the story in Ghosts.
Watch the video below to learn why the team didn't make Modern Warfare 4 and what makes Ghosts feel narratively distinct from previous entries.

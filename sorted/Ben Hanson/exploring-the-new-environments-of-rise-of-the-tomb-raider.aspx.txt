  Exploring The New Setting Of Rise Of The Tomb Raider






Stepping up from his role as art director for the last entry, Brian Horton is now the game director on Rise of the Tomb Raider and is paying a lot of attention to the look of Lara Croft's new environment. Rise of the Tomb Raider takes players to Russia as Lara seeks a long-lost city and answers about the existence of the immortal soul. The new setting means new animals to hunt, new challenges to overcome, and new tech that the team had to create to make the world believable.
Watch the video interview below to learn more about the new world/worlds you'll explore and why wolves are always so hungry for tomb raiders.

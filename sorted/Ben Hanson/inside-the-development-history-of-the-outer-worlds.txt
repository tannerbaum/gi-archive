  Inside The Development History Of The Outer Worlds






            We've been rolling out exclusive features highlighting The Outer Worlds all month, and with the video above we're diving in deep on the game's development. While visiting Obsidian Entertainment, we spoke with The Outer Worlds' co-directors Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky about how the project started and what it's like on the inside developing a focused, reactive RPG. Cain and Boyarsky started their partnership with the creation of the first Fallout at Interplay alongside Obsidian co-founders Feargus Urquhart and Chris Jones. After a long journey through the game industry, which brought them both to working on games like Vampire: The Masquerade, Boyarsky was lured away from Blizzard and his work on the Diablo series to rejoin Cain on the creation of this "space RPG". Learn the full story by watching the video above, and let us know what you think in the comments below.

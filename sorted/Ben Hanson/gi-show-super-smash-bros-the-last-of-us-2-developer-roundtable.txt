  GI Show - Super Smash Bros, The Last Of Us 2, Developer Roundtable






            We've seen a lot of games at E3 2018 so far and we're ready to talk about them! The day started out with the Nintendo Direct and also marked the first day of the show floor being open, so it was chaos. We're streaming the show from Los Angeles and will post the archive later on our site and the audio feed.

In the second half of the show, we're joined by Forza Horizon 4's creative director Dan Greenawalt, Remedy's Thomas Puha to talk about Control, and the director for Ori and the Will of the Wisps Thomas Mahler to talk about E3 2018 from a developer's perspective.

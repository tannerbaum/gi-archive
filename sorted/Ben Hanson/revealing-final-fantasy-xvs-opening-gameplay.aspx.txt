  An Extensive Look At Final Fantasy XV's First Chapter






With this month's cover reveal of Final Fantasy XV, we're hoping to explain to fans how the game plays and what exactly you'll be doing in this new world. You've seen a lot of trailers, but in this video feature we wanted to show off the actual gameplay from Final Fantasy XV's opening chapter. While visiting Square-Enix's headquarters in Tokyo, we sat down with the game's director Hajime Tabata to discuss what players will be doing in "Chapter 1" (through a translator provided by Square) and what makes it the most ambitious Final Fantasy yet.  We should point out that the gameplay featured in the video interview is from an early version of Final Fantasy XV, and does not represent the state of the shipping game.
Watch the video below to learn from Tabata about how the beginning calls back to Final Fantasy II and why he doesn't want people to think of Final Fantasy XV as an open-world game.

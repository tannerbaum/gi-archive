  GI Show – Mortal Kombat 11, Borderlands 3, Greatest Fighting Games Of All Time






            Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! We have an exciting episode for you all this week, fueled by our recent trip to NetherRealm Studios to learn all about Mortal Kombat 11. We also walk through why we all can't stop thinking about the strange reveal of Borderlands 3 and talk about some of our favorite indie games from PAX and GDC. After some great community emails, Andrew Reiner and Suriel Vazquez explain how the team at Game Informer created a list ranking the 30 greatest fighting games of all time.

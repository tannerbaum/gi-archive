  Harvey Smith Answers Your Dishonored 2 Questions






For the last month, we've been rolling out features in our hub to go along with our recent cover story on Arkane Studios' Dishonored 2. For the final entry in that hub, we Skyped in Dishonored 2's co-creative director Harvey Smith and asked him dozens of the community's burning questions. Check out the interview below to learn more about the existence (or lack there-of) of dinosaurs in Dishonored's world, the role of sexuality in the game, and what sort of games Smith might like to create in the future.
You can watch the video below, subscribe and listen to the audio on iTunes, or listen to the full episode on SoundCloud.

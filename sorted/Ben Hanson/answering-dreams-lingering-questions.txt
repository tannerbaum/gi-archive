  Answering Dreams' Lingering Questions






            We're wrapping up our month of coverage on Media Molecule's Dreams and we wanted to close things out with one last chance to have your biggest questions about the game answered. On this special edition of The Game Informer Show, we're joined by Dreams creative director Mark Healey and Media Molecule's studio director Siobhan Reddy to answer dozens of questions from the community. Just to set expectations, the team at Media Molecule outlines their plans for the beta but they don't give a specific release date. Other than that, there's a lot of good information in this episode!

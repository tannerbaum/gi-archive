  Hideo Kojima Reveals New Details On The Phantom Pain






To go along with our March cover story on Metal Gear Solid V we've given extensive hands-on impressions of the main story mission in Ground Zeroes, but now we're looking to the future. While visiting Kojima Productions in Tokyo, Game Informer's Tim Turi had the opportunity to ask Hideo Kojima all of our burning questions about the mysterious Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. While no release date has been set and the exact platforms haven't been locked down, Metal Gear's creator opened up and offered a few hints on what to expect both from the game's plot and new Mother Base mechanics. We should warn you ahead of time, these questions start out nerdy from a lore-perspective. Fans of Metal Gear, please let us know what you think of our questions and Kojima's answers in the comments below. 
Watch the video below to learn more about Zero's role in The Phantom Pain, whether we'll see a young Solid Snake in the game, and hints of the game's online functionality.

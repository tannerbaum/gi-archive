  The Music Of Batman: Arkham Knight






Note: The image above is from Batman: Arkham Asylum.
You should know the name Nick Arundel. As Rocksteady's audio director and composer of their now Arkham trilogy, his work has contributed greatly to help define the studio's take on Batman. While he has previously worked with Ron Fish on the soundtracks of both Asylum and City, Arundel is recruiting help from a certain talent from Hollywood to help compose Rocksteady's finale. We spoke with Arundel about his previous work in the series, how Scarecrow has influenced the new soundtrack, and he even shows off some new tracks from the game. If you're interested in more details on the gameplay, be sure to check out our content hub or read our April cover story for more details and to see screenshots from the game.
Watch the video feature below to learn more about Arundel's approach to music in the game that will end his work within the Arkham universe.

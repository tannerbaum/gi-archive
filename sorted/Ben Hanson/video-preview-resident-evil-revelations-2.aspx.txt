  Behind The Scares: New Gameplay Footage For Resident Evil Revelations 2






Yesterday we announced our November cover story on Resident Evil Revelations 2, and while our upcoming month of coverage is a celebration of the entire series, we wanted to get out of the gate by showing the next game in action. While visiting Japan, we sat down with Resident Evil Revelations 2's producer Michiteru Okabe to discuss the team's direction for the game. However the game turns out, Capcom is heavily emphasizing that their goal is to incorporate as much fan feedback as possible and craft Revelations 2 with an emphasis on true survival horror.
Watch the video interview with Okabe below to see the gameplay, learn about what Claire Redfield is up to, and hear why the team decided to make this the first episodic entry in the long-running series.

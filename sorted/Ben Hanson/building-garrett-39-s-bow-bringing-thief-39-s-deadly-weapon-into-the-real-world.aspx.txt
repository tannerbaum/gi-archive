  Building Garrett's Bow: Bringing Thief's Deadly Weapon Into The Real World






The latest Thief game from Eidos-Montreal has been in development for a long time. While the development team was hard at work designing and redesigning the systems, a small forge in Montreal was given the task of building the protagonist's bow for both marketing and research. In the spring of 2010, machinist Dan Nyborg and blacksmith Mathieu Collette spent one month designing and bringing Garrett's weapon to life. The forge has made props for films like the upcoming Riddick sequel and the unforgettable Adventures of Pluto Nash, but the complex and mechanical bow from Thief was one of their biggest challenges.

Watch the video below to see how the team created Garrett's bow and how their hard work ended up changing the weapon's design in the final game.

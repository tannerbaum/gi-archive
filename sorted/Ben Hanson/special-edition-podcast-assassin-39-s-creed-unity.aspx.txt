  Special Edition Podcast â€“ Assassin's Creed Unity






Last week we opened up the floor for our community to ask the creative director of Assassin's Creed Unity whatever they'd like to know, and we hope you all enjoy the result. Alex Amancio called in from PAX and we volleyed as many questions as his schedule allowed. Why do the actors in this game, which is set during the French Revolution, have British accents? How does the disguise mechanic work? Is co-op unlocked right out of the gate? All of these questions and more are answered, so give it a listen and let us know what you think in the comments below.

  Assassin's Creed Revelations: Scouting Istanbul






It's difficult to recreate a city that you've never visited. Ubisoft has learned that a sight-seeing trip can be crucial if the team wants to faithfully reconstruct an entire city. For Assassin's Creed Revelations, key members of the development team were sent to the city of Istanbul (not Constantinople) to absorb as much of the modern-day Constantinople as possible. Through soaking in the sights and sounds, as well as taking thousands upon thousands of photos, the team at Ubisoft was able to gather all the information they needed to send players back to 1511 to experience the city through the eyes of Ezio. Check out the video below to learn what is involved in a location scouting trip for a game in the Assassin's Creed series.

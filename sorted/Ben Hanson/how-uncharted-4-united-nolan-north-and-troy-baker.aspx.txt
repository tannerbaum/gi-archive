  How Uncharted 4 United Nolan North And Troy Baker






With our February cover story on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, we take a deep dive into the world and gameplay of Naughty Dog's next adventure. While we learned a lot from the developers, we also spoke with the actor who has helped create the character of Drake: Nolan North. Joining North in the new game is equally-renowned voice actor Troy Baker, playing Nathan's estranged brother Sam. We spoke with the two actors about their history together, the perception of their rivalry, and the personalities and inner conflicts behind the new sibling rivalry.
Watch the video below to hear Nolan North and Troy Baker discuss the intricacies of the characters in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

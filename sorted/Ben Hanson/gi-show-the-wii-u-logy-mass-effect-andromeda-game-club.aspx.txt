  GI Show – Wii U-logy And Mass Effect Game Club






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! Today's episode is full of fun information and close-range nostalgia. We start out talking about some recent game releases and announcements like Mr. Shifty, The Sexy Brutale, Mario Sports Superstars, the new Nintendo Direct, and Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition. Afterwards, Jeff Cork, Brian Shea, Kyle Hilliard, Ben Reeves, and I pay our full respects to the Wii U by traveling back to its beginning at E3 2011 and explaining why we're endlessly fascinated by so many finer details of Nintendo's retired console. After some great community emails, we dive into the uplifting middle chapter of our GI Game Club for Mass Effect: Andromeda with Joe Juba, Ben Reeves, Javy Gwaltney, and Elise Favis. We hope you enjoy the show!

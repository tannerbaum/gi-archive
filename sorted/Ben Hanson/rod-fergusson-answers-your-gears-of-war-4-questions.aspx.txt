We've reached the end of our month of coverage on Gears of War 4. This special edition podcast aims to fill in any gaps that we've missed. We asked the community for their burning questions and Skyped in studio head of The Coalition Rod Fergusson to get you all some answers. Ben Hanson and Ben Reeves visited the studio developing Gears of War 4 for the cover story, and are on the podcast with Fergusson to serve as the conduit for the community. The podcast will answer some questions for the hardcore and casual fans alike, including Fergusson's thoughts on Gears of War 4's shotgun and the upcoming Beta. We really hope you've enjoyed our month of content, it's been fun!

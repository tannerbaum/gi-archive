  Final Fantasy XV: Your Lingering Questions Answered






We replace the regular Game Informer Show this week with the last big Final Fantasy XV info blow-out. After spending a week at Square Enix for our May cover story on Final Fantasy XV, we asked the community about what they want to know about the lore, gameplay, and the development studio. While Joe Juba and Ben Hanson discussed their impressions of their exclusive hands-on time with the game weeks ago on the show, there are still a lot of details to go into and they're joined by Kimberley Wallace this time around to dive into the deep end.

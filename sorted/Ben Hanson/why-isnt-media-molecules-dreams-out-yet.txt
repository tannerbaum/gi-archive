  Why Isn't Media Molecule's Dreams Out Yet?






            While visiting Media Molecule's studio for Game Informer's latest cover story on Dreams, we were blown away by the creative potential for the next game from the creators of LittleBigPlanet. After seeing how well the game's tools simplify the process of creating games, and learning that story mode is made entirely from Dreams itself, we were left wondering... why is it taking so long to release Dreams? We sat down with Dreams' creative director Mark Healey and Media Molecule's studio director Siobhan Reddy to learn why the game that we first saw teased in 2013 isn't yet in our hands. Watch the video interview above and let us know what you think in the comments below.

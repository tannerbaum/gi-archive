  Ed Boon On Mortal Kombat's Biggest Misconception






            With Game Informer's latest cover story on Mortal Kombat 11, we're posting several new written and video features a week. Consider this smaller, bite-sized update a bonus. While visiting NetherRealm Studios, we spoke with Ed Boon both about the Mortal Kombat series' biggest misconception and why the team and Boon specifically are so eager to create something new. Watch the video above to learn more from Boon, and get ready for another feature on Friday about changing the look of some of the series' classic characters.

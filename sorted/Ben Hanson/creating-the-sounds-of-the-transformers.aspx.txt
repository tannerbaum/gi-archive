  Creating The Soundscape Of Transformers






When we decided upon Transformers as a cover story, I started asking around the office looking for ideas for our video coverage. Without a second of hesitation, Game Informer's own Jeff Cork demanded to learn how the team at High Moon Studios recreates the iconic sounds of the transformations. We are happy to say that we captured the process on video along with many other glimpses inside the creation of audio for Transformers: Fall of Cybertron.  Three separate videos each capture an element of the audio work being done for the game, from the fun of foley sound capturing, to working with the inimitable voice of Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen.
In the video below the audio team at High Moon Studios, led by lead sound designer Rob Burns, show off their foley studio that they use to recreate the sounds of Cybertron. They also demonstrate one of the perks of capturing sounds for a war game: detonating rockets.

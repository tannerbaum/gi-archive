  Exclusive Video On The Challenges Of Creating Sekiro's Dynamic World






            In order to write Game Informer's new cover story on From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, we traveled to Tokyo and spent two days in the studio learning all about and playing the game. While on the development floor, we were able to speak with Sekiro's lead concept designer Tetsu Takahashi and graphics engineer Takasuke Ando about bringing this new game to life. Watch the video above to learn how refreshing it is for this team to take a step away from Dark Souls and Bloodborne and create a new, more varied world both visually and thematically.

  Why XCOM: Enemy Unknown Is One Of The Best Games Of 2012






Ever since we featured XCOM: Enemy Unknown on the cover of the February issue of Game Informer, the excitement and passion for the game within the office has only grown. War stories from the alien-littered battlefields dominated every morning discussion and we were taught how a turn-based strategy game can lead to some of the most tense moments we have ever experienced in a game.
We gathered Game Informer editors Adam Biessener (read his review here), Dan Ryckert, Tim Turi, and Jeff Marchiafava to talk about their experience with the game and why it ranks so high in their favorite games of 2012.

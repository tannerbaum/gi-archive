  Ninja Theory On The Chances Of Heavenly Sword 2, Enslaved 2, DmC 2






With our cover story on Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, we're focusing on Ninja Theory's intriguing road ahead. But we'd also like to reflect on the studio's previous games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved, and DmC. Since the studio receives so many questions from fans about whether or not we'll see sequels to previous titles, we sat down with Hellblade's creative director Tameem Antoniades to get a final verdict on the chances of sequels ever being released. 
Watch the video below to learn some details on where Antoniades would want to take an Enslaved 2 or Heavenly Sword 2, and whether or not he'd ever want to create a follow-up to Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice.

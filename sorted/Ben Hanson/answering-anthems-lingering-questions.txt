  Answering Anthem's Lingering Questions






            All month long we've been rolling out features highlighting Anthem from BioWare.  With this special edition of The Game Informer Show, we handed the reigns over to the community to figure out what you wanted to learn about the game. We pulled dozens and dozens of questions from the community and Skyped in the game's director, Jon Warner, to answer as many as he could. If we don't ask a question in this show, it's either becuase the team has already answered the question elsewhere in our coverage or they 100% aren't talking about it yet. We cover comparisons to Destiny 2, what they can say about progression, and much more. Let us know what you think in the comments below.

  Why Evolve Is Not Just Another First-Person Shooter






When we revealed Evolve as February's cover story, there were a couple of commenters lamenting the release of yet another first-person shooter. Not even factoring in the playable monster in third-person, Evolve is aiming to bring you a focused experience that separates itself from the saturated market of Call of Duty clones. While visiting Turtle Rock Studios in southern California, we spoke with studio heads Chris Ashton and Phil Robb and executive producer Matt O'Driscoll about Evolve's fresh approach to multiplayer. We discuss the comparisons to Respawn's Titanfall, the power of contrast in multiplayer, and what the team learned from creating Left 4 Dead. To learn much more about Evolve, be sure to check out the latest issue of Game Informer for the full cover story.
Watch the video interview below to learn more about Evolve's unique 4 vs 1 approach to multiplayer.

  What's New In Destiny: Rise of Iron's Gameplay






This week we revealed our new cover story on Destiny: Rise of Iron from Bungie. We visited the studio and played a lot of the game (we'll be sharing our impressions in the near future) but for now we wanted to let game director Christopher Barrett and executive producer Scott Taylor explain what's changing and what's new with this year's expansion. Also, we should note that, thanks to the audio team at Bungie, the video features new music from Destiny: Rise of Iron.
Watch the video below to see new gameplay and learn what players will encounter in Destiny: Rise of Iron.

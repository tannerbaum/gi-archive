  From SSX To Army Of Two: The Pro Behind The Audio






You might not know the name Francois Lafleur, but this gregarious French-Canadian is the mind behind the audio in some of the most memorable games ever made. Defining the soundscape of the classic SSX, Need for Speed, and Skate series, Francois brought his unique flavor of sound design to Army of Two: The 40th Day and continues to expand upon his work with Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel. Watch the video below to see (and hear) the new game in action, and to see what Francois has learned through his own experience and from the talented sound teams at DICE and Visceral.

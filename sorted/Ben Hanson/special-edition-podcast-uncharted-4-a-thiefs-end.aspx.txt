  Special Edition Podcast: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End






Throughout the last month we've covered a lot of ground with our coverage on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, but we wanted to open the doors and let the Game Informer and Naughty Dog communities directly ask game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann questions about the game. The studio is still holding a lot of their cards close to their chest, but we asked them dozens and dozens of questions and I think you'll learn a thing or two about the fourth entry in the beloved series.

Listen to the podcast below to learn more from Straley and Druckmann about Sam Drake, some nitty-gritty game design decisions, and what it's like to work on the PlayStation 4.

  Norse And Beyond: Expanding God Of War's Mythology






In our new cover story on God of War, we're highlighting everything that's new in the upcoming PlayStation 4 game. With today's feature we wanted to put our head in the clouds and learn more about how the development team at Santa Monica Studio is framing Kratos' radical shift in mythologies. While visiting the studio, we spoke with creative director Cory Barlog and studio head Shannon Studstill about the bold decision to have Kratos leave all of Greece behind, why they didn't choose Egyptian mythology for his next adventure, and the specifics on how the game's mythology world is pieced together.
Watch the interview below to learn more about what the shift in mythology means for the future of the series.

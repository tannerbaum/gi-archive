Dan Tack and Suriel Vazquez also talk about the new game from CD Projekt RED... it's a card game called Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales. After some great emails sent to podcast@gameinformer.com, we're honored to be joined in person by Enhance Games' Tetsuya Mizuguchi and Mark MacDonald to talk about Tetris Effect and answer 78 rapid-fire questions about his history at Sega, Lumunies, Rez, and vibrations.

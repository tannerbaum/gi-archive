  The Biggest Decisions Behind Uncharted: The Lost Legacy






With our cover story on Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, we offered an exclusive look at the game fans will be playing by the end of 2017. With today's update we wanted to take a look behind the scenes and talk about Naughty Dog's process of developing this stand-alone Uncharted adventure. The last time we spoke with Naughty Dog's Josh Scherr he was stepping up to become co-writer on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Now he has a new writing partner for Unhcharted: The Lost Legacy through the game's creative director Shaun Escayg. In this interview, Scherr talks about the development history of the new game, why they chose Chloe as the protagonist, and why (even after all of these years) it's still very hard to make an Uncharted game.

  Naughty Dog's New Vision For Uncharted: The Lost Legacy






We're excited to kick off a month of coverage on Naughty Dog's Uncharted: The Lost Legacy to coincide with our new cover story on the game. We have a lot of new details on the game in the cover story itself, but for a quick rundown of the team's vision of the game we sat down with creative director Shaun Escayg and game director Kurt Margenau. Learn what held Naughty Dog back from creating more large, open spaces in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and why they're excited about creating new, bold setpieces for players.
Watch the video below to learn more about the benefits of creating a game smaller than Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and what stage they're at right now in development.

  Debating The Bros And Cons Of The Army Of Two Series






There was a clear divide in the response to theÂ unveiling of our cover story for Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel. There's a strong percentage of people that play game that look down their nose at the series, seeing it as a "dude-bro" festival of bullets with no redeeming value or creativity. The series also has defenders; we've seen hundreds of people complain about the decision to change protagonists this time around and applaud the games for their entertaining and action-packed co-op campaign. This division carries over into the Game Informer office as well. Check out the video below to see managing editor Matt Bertz, senior associate editor Jeff Cork, and associate editor Dan Ryckert debate the history and future of the Army of Two series.

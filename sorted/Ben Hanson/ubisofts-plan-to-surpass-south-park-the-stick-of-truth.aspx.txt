  Ubisoft’s Plan To Surpass South Park: The Stick Of Truth






All this month at Game Informer, we're rolling out exclusive features that take a deep dive into Ubisoft's South Park: The Fractured But Whole. We really loved Obsidian's South Park: The Stick of Truth, but it certainly wasn't perfect. Now, the developers at Ubisoft San Francisco have broken down key areas they hope to improve upon the last RPG's formula for the upcoming South Park: The Fractured But Whole.
We spoke with senior producer Jason Schroeder and director of design Paul Cross to talk about their thoughts on the last game and what it's like to craft a whole new experience with Matt Stone and Trey Parker. We should point out, the video contains minor spoilers for South Park: The Stick of Truth and some adult language.
Watch the video below to learn how the team is aiming to improve South Park's combat, world, and length.

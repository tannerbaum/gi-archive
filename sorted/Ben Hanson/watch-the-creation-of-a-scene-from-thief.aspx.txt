  Watch The Creation Of A Scene From Thief






In the middle of what looks like a construction zone, the team behind Thief is using a brand new motion-capture studio from a company called Game On in Montreal to capture both the game's animations and voice work. Both Game On and Square Enix were kind enough to let us bring in our cameras and film the process of capturing several cutscenes from the upcoming Thief reboot.
Watch the video below to see the team direct and film the actors, and learn all about the process of bringing the new Thief to life.

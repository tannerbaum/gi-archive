  Revealing The Story Of Batman: Arkham Knight






To coincide with our April cover for Batman: Arkham Knight, every other day we'll be posting an exclusive feature detailing an aspect of the game. While the CGI trailer hinted at some of the characters that will be in the game, we wanted to kick things off by having the developers at Rocksteady Studios explain the premise and new details on the game's plot.
For the first time in Rocksteady's Arkham games, renowned Batman writer Paul Dini will not be involved. The studio is still consulting with DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns but are relying on their team of in-house writers to craft the story. Game director Sefton Hill is leading the writing team, and he pulled in senior script writer Martin Lancaster (who has worked on the Crysis and Killzone series) to help shape the plot.
Watch the video below to learn more about the game's setting, what the villains (including Arkham Knight) are up to, shaping the perfect ending to the series, and the odds of seeing The Joker in this game.

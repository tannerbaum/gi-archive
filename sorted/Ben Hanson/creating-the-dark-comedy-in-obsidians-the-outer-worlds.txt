  Creating The Dark Comedy In Obsidian's The Outer Worlds






            All month long we've been rolling out exclusive features highlighting Obsidian's upcoming RPG The Outer Worlds. While visiting the studio, we sat down with co-directors Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky to talk about the game's tone and how it compares to their creation of the original Fallout. We should stress that there's a talented team of writing within Obsidian writing the game, but Cain and Boyarsky help define the overall tone and vision. Check out the video above and let us know what you think of The Outer Worlds in the comments below.

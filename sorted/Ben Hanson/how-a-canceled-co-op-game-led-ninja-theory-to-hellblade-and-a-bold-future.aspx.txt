  How Ninja Theory's Canceled Co-op Game Led To Hellblade's Bold Future






With our new cover story on Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, we've shown off plenty of gameplay footage from Ninja Theory's game. Today, the game's creative directorÂ Tameem Antoniades explains more about how the talented studio arrived where they are today. After an ambitious game named "Razer" was rejected from publishers, the team made the decision to think outside of the box and develop and publish Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. So what does the future look like for Ninja Theory? We spoke with Antoniades about the studio's split going forward between safer/licensed games and escaping the publisher cycle with more experimental experiences like Hellblade.
Watch the video below to see more gameplay footage from Hellblade and learn about the team's creative journey moving forward.

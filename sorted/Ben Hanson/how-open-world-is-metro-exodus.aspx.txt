  How "Open-World" Is Metro Exodus?






With our new cover story on Metro Exodus from 4A Games, we go into a lot of detail on the sequel's biggest changes to gameplay. With this video feature, we want to focus in on perhaps the biggest change. Leaving Moscow behind, Metro Exodus has Artyom journeying across post-apocalyptic Russia through a series of open regions. Pulling from the team's history with S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they are attempting to create a fusion between that fully open world game and some of the more memorable spaces from Metro: Last Light like the swamp level. In the video below, watch the game's creative director Andriy "Prof" Prokhorov and executive producer Jon Bloch show off the scope of the world and much more.
Learn all about the development of Metro Exodus' open regions in the video below.

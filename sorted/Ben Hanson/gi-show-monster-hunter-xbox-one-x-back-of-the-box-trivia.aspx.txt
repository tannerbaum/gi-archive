  GI Show – Monster Hunter, Xbox One X, Back Of The Box Trivia






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this week's episode, we open up and talk about our new cover story on Monster Hunter: World, Andrew Reiner talks about the difficulty behind recommending the Xbox One X and shares thoughts on Battlefront II's campaign, and Brian Shea regales us with what it's like to play Sonic Forces. For community emails, we're joined by community member Zachary Pligge to talk about Extra Life 2017 and much more. For the back half of the podcast, Kyle Hilliard hosts a round of back of the box game trivia... and it's really hard.

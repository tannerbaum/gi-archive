  Revealing The Origins Of The Order: 1886






If you've been following our month of exclusive coverage for The Order: 1886, you've already learned about the gameplay and storyÂ and met the knights that will fight alongside Galahad, but we wanted to let you know where this ambitious new IP came from. While visiting Ready at Dawn, we spoke with creative director Ru Weerasuriya and chief technology officer Andrea Pessino about the development history of their PS4 exclusive. We cover a lot of ground: why they were inspired to pull from history, pitching the game to Sony, the benefits and struggles of building your own engine, and the pressure of debuting the trailer.
Watch the video below to learn the full story behind the game's development and which Emmy-award winner will be co-writing the game.

  Eidos-Montreal And The Overshadowing Thief Legacy






Eidos-Montreal is no stranger to fan expectations. In 2011, it released Deus Ex: Human Revolution, a prequel to one of the greatest games of all time. Now a separate team within the studio is working on a reinvention of Thief, the classic stealth game from Looking Glass. While many fans are excited to play more within a modern reinterpretation of that universe, a vocal group has already bemoaned the redesign of Garrett and an emphasis on bringing the classic design up to the standards of today.
Watch the video below to hear how the team studied the old games, why they hope fans will support their work, and what the future holds for Eidos-Montreal.

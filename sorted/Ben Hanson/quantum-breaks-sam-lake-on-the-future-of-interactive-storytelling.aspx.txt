  Quantum Break's Sam Lake On The Future Of Interactive Storytelling






Game Informer's cover story for December is Remedy Entertainment's Quantum Break. We've been rolling out features that highlight different aspects of the game, but we wanted to focus in on the game's creative director Sam Lake and speak about his perception of the state of interactive storytelling. Known for his work on Max Payne and Alan Wake, Sam Lake has been a strong proponent of the storytelling potential of the medium and is tackling a new challenge with Quantum Break's embedded television show.  
We speak with Lake about weighing the value of interactivity, the power of using storytelling cliches, and what he sees as the future of interactive storytelling.
Watch the video interview below to learn more from Remedy Entertainment's Sam Lake about the challenges of modern storytelling.

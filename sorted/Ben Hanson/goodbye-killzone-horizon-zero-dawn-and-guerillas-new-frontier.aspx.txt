  Goodbye Killzone: Horizon Zero Dawn And Guerrilla's New Frontier






To go along with our October cover story on Horizon Zero Dawn from Guerrilla Games, we've been rolling out features highlighting the impressive new game. We've already taken you inside the development history of the action-RPG, but with this interview we wanted to sit down with Guerrilla Games' managing director Hermen Hulst to speak specifically about what it's like for the studio to leave the Killzone series behind and create the vast world of Horizon Zero Dawn. It's an interesting transition period for the studio, so we speak about what is at the core of Guerrilla Games' DNA and how fans of Killzone might feel more at home than they think fighting robotic dinosaurs.
Watch the video interview with Hulst below to learn more about the potential future of Killzone, the importance of an inspired team, and how RIGS on PlayStation VR fits in to Guerrilla's strategy.

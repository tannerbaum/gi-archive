  Inside The Creation Of Sekiro's Soundtrack






            While visiting From Software for our latest cover story on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, we were fortunate enough to sit down and speak with the game's music composer Yuka Kitamura. Fans have celebrated Kitamura's previous work on Dark Souls and Bloodborne (her favorite track is currently Slave Knight Gael from Dark Souls 3) and are eager to hear more of what she has in mind for the completely new world of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Watch the video above to learn about the instruments and themes she's focusing on this time around and what it's like to collaborate with the currently unnamed external composer helping out with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

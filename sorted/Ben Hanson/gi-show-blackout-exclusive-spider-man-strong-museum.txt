  GI Show – Blackout Exclusive, Spider-Man, Strong Museum Of Play






            Game Informer's Ben Hanson, Dan Tack, and Javy Gwaltney share exclusive, new gameplay impressions from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's battle royale mode called Blackout. Then Andrew Reiner and Kyle Hilliard stop by to talk about why they love Insomniac's Spider-Man on PS4 and share new details on Fallout 76 from an interview with Todd Howard. We also break down the best games from PAX 2018, including an in-depth discussion about Valve's DOTA 2 card game Artifact. After some great community emails, we're joined by Jeremy K. Saucier who is the assistant vice president for interpretation and electronic games at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York to talk about game preservation and their toy hall of fame.

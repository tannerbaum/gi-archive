  Answering Mortal Kombat 11's Lingering Questions






            All month long we've been rolling out exclusive features covering Mortal Kombat 11. Earlier this week we opened things up to the community and received hundreds and hundreds of burning questions, and on this special episode of The Game Informer Show we've Skyped in NetherRealm designer Derek Kirtzic to answer as many of those questions as he can. Check out the interview to learn more about the Nintendo Switch version, how the team chooses characters, NPCs, stage transformations, and much more.

  What Is Fortnite?






The world learned that Epic was working on a game called Fortnite in 2011, but since then we've only heard rumblings and brief statements on the game's existence. With our May cover story and month of exclusive content rolling out in our hub, we're hoping to answer every question you might have about Epic's next big game. We're starting out with the basics – a video with producer Roger Collum and lead designer Darren Sugg explaining what Fortnite's gameplay is like and their approach to releasing a free-to-play game. Be sure to read the full cover story on Fortnite to learn much more.

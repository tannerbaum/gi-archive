  How The Coalition Became Gears Of War's New Home






When Microsoft purchased Gears of War from Epic, fans were surprised that a mysterious and unproven studio in Vancouver called Black Tusk would be handling the development. After shifting away from their teased new IP, joining forces with Gears veteran Rod Fergusson, and changing their name to The Coalition, there were a lot of questions about what the new development studio would mean for Gears of War. While visiting The Coalition for our April cover story on Gears of War 4, we spoke with the studio's director of operations Mike Crump and new studio head Rod Fergusson about the full journey to become the new development home for Gears of War.
Watch the video below to learn how a relatively untested team is training to make the next Gears of War.

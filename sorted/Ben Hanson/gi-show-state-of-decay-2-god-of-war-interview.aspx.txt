  GI Show – State Of Decay 2, Rage 2, God Of War Interview






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On today's episode, we talk about the fun and frustrations to be had in State of Decay 2 from Undead Labs with Jeff Cork, Jeff Marchiafava, and Andrew Reiner. Then Javy Gwaltney and Leo Vader join the crew to talk about the survival game The Forest that was finally released and the reveal of Rage 2 from Bethesda. Then we keep on going with Matt Kato, Suriel Vazquez, and Kyle Hilliard talking about Descenders and Laser League. After some great community emails, we're joined by Sony Santa Monica's Matt Sophos and Richard Gaubert to talk about writing the new God of War. If you're worried about spoilers, don't worry – we give a clear warning before we start diving into them.

  Designing Saints Row's New City






After two games set in the fictional city of Stilwater, the team behind Saints Row was ready to shake things up a bit. We sat down with the two art directors behind Saints Row: The Third to talk about the process of designing a city from scratch and how the new location kickstarted the art team's imagination at Volition. Check out the video to discover why Steelport will be a city to remember.

  Inside The Unique Technology Behind Metal Gear Solid V






With his roots programming games for Ubisoft in the mid-90s, Julien Merceron has worked his way through the halls of Eidos and Square Enix before becoming Konami's worldwide technology director in 2013. Now Merceron is tackling Konami's most technologically-ambitious title yet in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. 
 Merceron is pulling from his experience with creating the open worlds of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Just Cause to ensure that the Fox Engine is up to the task and matching Hideo Kojima's vision. As a westerner that has worked extensively with Japanese publishers, Merceron has a unique viewpoint on the cultural differences with technology between the two regions. While licensing the Fox Engine to other companies at this point is "not a priority", Merceron has high hopes of steering this flexible engine into any possible future. To see more of this new engine in action, you can watch this video highlighting the visual differences in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes between the consoles and generations.
Watch the video below to learn why the Fox Engine stands out in Japanese game development and how The Phantom Pain expands on the tech and ideas of Ground Zeroes.

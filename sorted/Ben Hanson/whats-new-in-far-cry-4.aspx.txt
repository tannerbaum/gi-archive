  What's New In Far Cry 4






With Far Cry 4, Ubisoft Montreal recruited a fresh creative director. Alex Hutchinson had just wrapped up Assassin's Creed III,Â and his passion for creating systemic, player-driven narrative meshed well with the interests of the Far Cry development team. While there was a lot to love about the gameplay in Far Cry 3, the lead developers all had areas that they wanted to improve for the sequel. We spoke with Hutchinson about the debates behind including open-world co-op and what they've learned from games like Army of Two: 40th Day, Left 4 Dead, and Gears of War.
Watch the interview below to learn what they're changing from Far Cry 3 and what Hutchinson sees as the most difficult aspect of the game's development.

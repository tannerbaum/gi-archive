  The Secrets Behind Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare's Audio






There's a lot to absorb from the gameplay of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, but one of the key things that stood out when we saw the game in action for our June cover story was the audio. Audio director Don Veca created the lauded soundscape of the first Dead Space and is now bringing his talents to Sledgehammer Games' first wholly developed game. Veca and his audio team have thrown out all sounds from previous Call of Duty games and are creating their grounded take on the future from scratch. Alongside the focused sounds of gunfire, the game is scored by Audiomachine (known for scoring Hollywood trailers) and also marks the return of Harry Gregon-Williams for the first time since the original Modern Warfare.
Watch the video below to learn more about Veca's work on Dead Space, what he thinks of his audio competition in the shooter market, and to hear sounds from Advanced Warfare, .

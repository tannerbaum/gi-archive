  Answering Destiny: Rise Of Iron's Lingering Questions






We've had a lot of info to share about Destiny: Rise of Iron this month, as chronicled through our hub of dedicated articles, interviews, and videos. As we near the end of  cover story-related coverage, we opened the floor to questions from the community, and then brought those questions directly to the lead developers. On this special edition of the podcast, Ben Hanson and Matt Miller are joined by Destiny: Rise of Iron's game director Chris Barrett and executive producer Scott Taylor to answer pages and pages of questions from fans. This episode is made for Destiny fans out there, so check it out (and share it with a friend) if you want to learn more about the origins of Exos, the potential for Destiny's universe to branch out to novels and comic books, and what Bungie thinks of No Man's Sky UI.

  Oculus' Jason Rubin On VR's Future And Crash Bandicoot's Past






On Tuesday we unveiled Game Informer's cover story for January, a look ahead to the VR experiences in 2016. Throughout the month, we're going to be rolling out new content in our hub that covers the highlights of Oculus, PlayStation VR, and the Vive's efforts in this reinvigorated field of game development. To kick things off, we wanted to take a deep dive into the challenges of developing for virtual reality with the president of worldwide studios for Oculus Jason Rubin. Rubin has had an incredible career in the game industry, co-founding Naughty Dog with his business partner Andy Gavin and being the key creative input behind franchises like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter before becoming the president of THQ. In this special edition podcast, I spoke to Rubin about the intense development of Naughty Dog's early years and how the wild west of VR development mirrors those experimental days in the game industry.

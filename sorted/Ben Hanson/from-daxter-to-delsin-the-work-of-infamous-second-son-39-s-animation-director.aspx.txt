  From Daxter To Delsin: The Work Of Infamous Second Son's Animation Director






Every game is informed by those that have come before it. Animation director Billy Harper has some stellar titles on his resume, which inspired his current work on Infamous Second Son. Starting out on Mark of Kri for the PS2 (a game seen as a pioneer in 3D game animation) and moving on to the Jak and Daxter series, Harper is now taking advantage of the Playstation 4's horsepower to animate the new protagonist for Infamous Second Son Delsin Rowe. 
Watch the video below to learn what lessons from Mark of Kri have stuck with Harper and how the animation in Infamous Second Son will differ from Infamous 2.

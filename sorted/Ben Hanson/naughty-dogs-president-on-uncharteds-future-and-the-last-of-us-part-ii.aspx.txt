  Naughty Dog's President On Uncharted's Future And Last Of Us Part II






With our cover story on Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, we focused on the stand-alone game starring Chloe that PlayStation 4 owners will be playing this year. However, we can't help but be excited for what Naughty Dog is working on for the future too. We sat down with the president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells to talk about what The Lost Legacy means for the potential future of the Uncharted series, the studio's growing pains, rolling back the drive for two full development teams, and the early stages of creating The Last of Us Part II.
Watch our video to learn the roadmap for Naughty Dog's promising future.

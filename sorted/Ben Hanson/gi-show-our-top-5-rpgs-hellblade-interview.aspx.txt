  GI Show – Our Top Five RPGs, Ninja Theory Interview






We have a great, big, and funky episode of The Game Informer Show for you today. The June cover story for our magazine focuses on "The Top 100 RPGs Of All Time". But, since we're an office of passionate RPG-lovers, we all have our own opinions and favorites as well. So join Ben Hanson, Suriel Vazquez, Joe Juba, Javy Gwaltney, and Dan Tack as we break down our personal five favorite RPGs. After some great community emails with Ben Reeves, we're joined by Ninja Theory's co-founder and creative director Tameem Antoniades to answer questions from the community about DmC, Heavenly Sword, and their upcoming Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Enjoy the show!

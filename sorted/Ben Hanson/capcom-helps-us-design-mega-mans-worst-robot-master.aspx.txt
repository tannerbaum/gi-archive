  Capcom Helps Us Design Mega Man's Worst Robot Master






With our January cover story on Mega Man 11, we offer insight into how a small team within Capcom resurrected the Mega Man franchise, share exclusive impressions of what it's like to play the game.
With this feature, we show the new development team in action ... sort of. Game Informer's Ben Reeves grabs a whiteboard and walks through the process of designing a new boss with Mega Man 11's director Koji Oda, producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, and art director Yuji Ishihara. We should stress there's no way this creation is making it into the game. If you want to learn more about the real Robot Masters in Mega Man 11, check out our feature where we share all we know.
Watch the video below to see Ben Reeves live out his childhood dream of creating a new (and unusable) Robot Master for Mega Man.

  How Mafia III's Story "Pushes Boundaries"






We've already given fans a look at the reinvented gameplay of Mafia III, but with this feature we wanted to dive into a crucial aspect of the Mafia franchise: storytelling. With a new creative team at the helm and a new era and setting to tackle, there are a lot of unknowns for fans. While visiting the studio for our November cover story on Mafia III, we spoke with creative director Haden Blackman and lead writer Bill Harms about the team's approach to constructing Mafia III's narrative. From the game's approach to conveying a believable 1968 to its handling of the era's racial issues, there's a lot of ground to cover so we hope you enjoy the discussion.

  Exclusive Walkthrough Of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare's Grazna Raid Map






            This month we've been rolling out exclusive features showing off Infinity Ward's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, with the video above we wanted to get specific. While visiting the studio, we sat down with the game's multiplayer design director Geoffrey Smith to focus on one of the game's maps called Raid. Smith has been designing Call of Duty maps since Call of Duty 2 and explains the team's philosophy toward creating multiple lanes while still getting away from a more symmetrical "arena" design. Watch the video above to see Smith fly around the map and explain everything you need to know.

  Inside The Challenging Origins Of Horizon Zero Dawn






During Sony's press conference at E3 2015, the world was introduced to an brand-new world from the creators of Killzone that featured mechanical dinosaurs and a protagonist named Aloy. In this video feature, we bring viewers further back in time and behind the scenes of Horizon Zero Dawn's development within the halls of Guerilla Games. While visiting the Dutch studio for our October cover story, we spoke with the game's art director Jan-Bart van Beek, game director Mathijs de Jonge, and the studio's managing director Hermen Hulst about the challenges of creating such a bold game.
Watch the video below to learn how 80s cartoons, Duplo, and Killzone 3's Jammer helped forge the PlayStation 4's Horizon Zero Dawn.

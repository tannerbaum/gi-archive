  The Creative Director's Vision For Halo 4






As the co-creator of NBA Street and co-founder of Propaganda Games, Josh Holmes may sound like an odd choice for the creative director of Halo 4. Starting out testing sports games at EA (click here to see this bonus video where he talks about his worst day in the industry), Josh is a 15-year veteran of the gaming industry and he has worshipped Halo for 10 of those years. We asked him to share his first memories of playing Halo: Combat Evolved, what he sees as the pillars of the Halo series, and what changes he would like to make to the formula. Watch the video below and let us know what you think in the comments below.

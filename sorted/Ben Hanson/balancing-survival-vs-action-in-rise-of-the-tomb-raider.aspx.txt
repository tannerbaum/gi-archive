  Balancing Survival Vs. Action In Rise Of The Tomb Raider






Leading up to the release of the Tomb Raider reboot in 2013, Crystal Dynamics pushed the theme that Lara Croft was a survivor. While the survival aspects certainly were a large part of the story, the game didn't cross the line of becoming a systems-driven "survival game." While visiting Crystal Dynamics for our March cover story on Rise of the Tomb Raider, we spoke with creative director Noah Hughes about finding that balance, which the team dubbed "survival-action."  We also discuss how things are changing for Rise of the Tomb Raider, including surviving in larger hubs and the incentives for hunting.
Watch the video below to learn more about creating an "upside-design oriented" survival system for the Tomb Raider reboot and what the team learned from games like Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.

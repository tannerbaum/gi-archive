  Music Of The Spheres: The Collaborative Soundscape Of Destiny






Audio director and lead composer Marty O'Donnell is leaving the music of Halo behind and building a whole new aural world. Luckily, he has some company. Collaborating with the now in-house audio design lead and fellow composer Mike Salvatori and new partner, Paul McCartney, the three have created a soundtrack for Destiny that spans our entire solar system. In addition to the game's ambitious soundtrack, the trio are releasing a full musical prequel project with a track dedicated to each of the planets called Music of the Spheres. While visiting Bungie for our January cover story, we spoke with O'Donnell and Salvatori about the process of crafting the new game's soundtrack.
Watch the video feature below to hear O'Donnell show off Destiny's soundtrack and explain the process of working with Salvatori and McCartney.

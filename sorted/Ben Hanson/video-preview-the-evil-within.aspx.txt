  Dissecting The Horror Of The Evil Within's New Gameplay






As part of our October cover story on the past and future of horror games, Game Informer executive editor Andrew Reiner played through and wrote extensively about the first five chapters of The Evil Within. You can learn more about the game from its creator Shinji Mikami of Resident Evil fame, or you can watch Reiner's video discussion about the game with horror-fan Tim Turi. They talk about the game's variety of horror influences, how they all tie together into one world, and why it has more in common with Eternal Darkness than you'd expect.Â 
Watch the video below to see new gameplay from The Evil Within and learn about how the game compares to classics like Resident Evil 4.

  Can Assassin's Creed Unity Pull Off A Love Story?






We've already focused on the new gameplay that can be found in Assassin's Creed Unity, but for last week we wanted to highlight the game's story. You can learn much more about the characters of Arno and Elise in our dedicated profiles that we posted. While visiting Ubisoft Montreal for our September cover story,Â we spoke with creative director Alex Amancio about the difficulty of creating a love story within a game. Pulling from examples like Ico and Passage, Amancio and his team are attempting to make the bond between Elise and Arno front and center in the minds of players. Be sure to post a comment below with your thoughts on the team's approach and whether other games you've played have successfully tackled a love story.
Watch the interview below to learn more about Amancio's thoughts on the difficulty of pulling together an in-game love story.

  Special Edition Podcast - Batman: Arkham Knight






We've seen Batman: Arkham Knight in action and we're excited to talk about it. We've recorded this special edition of the podcast to go along with our April cover story on Rocksteady's final Arkham game. We've gathered some of the better questions from the community, attempted to answer them, and even added a new theory or two. Listen to the podcast below to hear Bryan Vore, Jeff Cork, and Ben Hanson talk exclusively and extensively about Batman: Arkham Knight.

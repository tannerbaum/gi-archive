  The Biggest Changes To Dishonored 2's Gameplay






With our June cover story on Dishonored 2 from Arkane Studios, we talk about our experience seeing the game in action. With this video feature, we wanted to give the developers behind the sequel the chance to explain in their own words how things are changing this time around. While visiting Arkane Studios' office in Lyon, we spoke with creative director Harvey Smith and lead designer Dinga Bakaba about what differences players will experience when picking up the controller this time around. They cover a lot of ground, from emphasizing player customization with modifiers to a bold approach for the sequel's level design. The video also debuts several pieces of music from Dishonored 2's soundtrack.

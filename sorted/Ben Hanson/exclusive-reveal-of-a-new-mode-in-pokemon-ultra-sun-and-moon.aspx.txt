  Exclusive Reveal Of A New Mode In Pokémon Ultra Sun And Moon






We're ending our stretch of exclusive features covering Pokémon with a video feature showing off Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon in action. While visiting Game Freak, we stopped by the desk of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon's director Kazumasa Iwao and he showed off the Alola Photo Club. The game marks Iwao's directorial debut, and he has been with Game Freak since the development of Pokémon Black and White. For more information on the new mode before you watch the video, here's how the The Pokémon Company is explaining it...
At the Alola Photo Club, you can take pictures with your Pokémon. You can choose from a variety of poses for yourself and your Pokémon and also freely control the composition of the shot, including the angle, and position of the subjects in the scene. By taking pictures with your Pokémon, you can deepen your friendship even more! After you’ve taken your picture, you can decorate the shot with various stamps and frames and share the finished result with other players using the communication features of the game.
Watch the video below to see Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon's Alola Photo Club in action.

            Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this week's episode, we're talking all about Game Informer's latest cover story on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Then Andrew Reiner joins the podcast to talk about Game Informer's game of the year winner and other categories like top ten characters, moments, and dorks. After some great community emails, we're joined by Sumo Digital's Paul Porter and Karl Hilton to talk about the surprising studio's history, developing Crackdown 3, and what the studio's connection with Timesplitters might mean for the future.

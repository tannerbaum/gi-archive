  An Exclusive Roundtable With Destiny: Rise Of Iron's Story Team






Visiting Bungie for our cover stories on the original Destiny and Destiny: The Taken King, there's always been one aspect of Bungie's universe that has eluded the spotlight: The writing team. This time, with our cover story on Destiny: Rise of Iron, we finally got the opportunity to meet and speak with some of the key figures responsible for continuing the story of Destiny. 
Game Informer's senior previews editor (and Destiny lore fanatic) Matt Miller is honored to sit down with lead writer Chris Schlerf, senior writer Christine Thompson, writer Jill Scharr, and cinematic lead Matthew Ward to talk about the evolution of characters and storytelling in Destiny. The video discussion starts out on broader topics including the challenges of writing the Grimoire and adding humor to the game, but continues on into an intricate discussion covering the history of the Iron Lords, the importance of flavor text for equipment, and the potential future of key Destiny characters, including some choice tidbits about the mysterious Efrideet. Also, we should note, in the video the team occasionally refers to Destiny: Rise of Iron by its internal Bungie name "DLC 3".
Watch the video discussion below (or watch and share it on YouTube) to learn from the team what it takes to write Destiny: Rise of Iron, how they think the game compares to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the ways they're inspired by Arthurian legend, and whether Cayde is ever going to get out of the Tower.

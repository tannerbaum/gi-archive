  Inside Call Of Duty's Plan To Make The Scariest Zombies Mode Ever






While visiting Sledgehammer Games for our new cover story on Call of Duty: WWII, we got a chance to play the game's fresh take on the classic Nazi Zombies mode. The mode's creative director Cameron Dayton and senior director of development Jon Horsley sat down with us to talk about how the team is hoping to use Sledgehammer Gamess' unique perspective (the studio contains a lot of developers that worked on Dead Space) to create a more intense and scary experience for players.
Watch the video below to learn how the team hopes to make a more accessible (but deep) version of Nazi Zombies.

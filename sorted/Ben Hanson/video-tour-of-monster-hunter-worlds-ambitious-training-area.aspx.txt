  Video Tour Of Monster Hunter: World's Ambitious Training Area






With Monster Hunter: World, Capcom is attempting to walk the fine line of satisfying fans while also roping in a whole new audience for the series' grand return to consoles. In our cover story on the game, we walk through a lot of the little details and tweaks that make this the most accessible entry yet. One of the major additions for newcomers is a thorough training area that lets players try out any weapon they want while not under attack from giant monsters.
Watch the video below as Jeff Cork and I show off everything you can do in the new training area.

  Dead Island Devs On Surviving Minecraft, DayZ, And Zombie Fatigue






The developers behind Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide have been thinking about zombies on a daily basis for years. Resident Game Informer zombie expert Tim Turi can't stop pouring zombie and survival fiction into his mind. We thought it would be a good idea to get them all together in a casual round table discussion on the rise in popularity of zombies and survival-based gameplay.
Watch the discussion below to hear Deep Silver's Sebastian Reichert, Alex Toplansky, and Nikolay Stoyanov's thoughts on DayZ, Minecraft, The Walking Dead, H.G. Wells, Dead Island, and Skyrim. I hope you enjoy!

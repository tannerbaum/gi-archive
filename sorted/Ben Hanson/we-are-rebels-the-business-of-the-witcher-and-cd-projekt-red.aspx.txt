  We Are Rebels: The Business Of The Witcher And CD Projekt Red






Based in Warsaw, Poland, CD Projekt Red has quietly become one of the most beloved studios in the gaming industry. The game development studio is housed under the larger CD Projekt company that also distributes Disney films in Poland and runs GOG.com. Based on the Polish novels, the Witcher license has given CD Projekt Red an opportunity to create mature RPGs that have garnered high critical praise and a devoted fanbase. Partnering with publishers like Atari and Warner Bros. in the past only to help distribute their games across the world, the studio puts a strong emphasis on creative independence.

Watch the video below to learn from the vice president of business development at CD Projekt Red how the studio acquired the Witcher license and how they are funding the massive project that is The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

  The Big Decisions Of Destiny's Development






With around 500 developers now working on the project, Destiny has ballooned to become one of the largest projects in game development history. Technical art director Ryan Ellis was there from the beginning. As one of the first people assigned to the top secret "Destiny" game at Bungie, Ellis has watched and helped shape this sci-fi epic into what it has become today. As technical art director, Ellis is responsible for making sure the game looks as good as possible across all of the game's many platforms. While visiting Bungie for our January cover story, I spoke with Ellis about the early days of the then third-person game, the balance between scientific accuracy and fun, and the possibility of a PC release.

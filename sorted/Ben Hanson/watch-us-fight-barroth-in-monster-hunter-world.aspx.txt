  Watch Us Fight The Mighty Barroth In Monster Hunter: World






One of the first big fights you encounter in Monster Hunter: World's Wildspire Waste map is against the giant Barroth. In today's video, to go alongside our cover story on the game, we show off a lot of new gameplay surrounding that fight. Watch Capcom's Yuri, myself, and Jeff Cork work together to take down this mud-covered, steam-whistling beast.

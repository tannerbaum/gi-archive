  Series Creator Hidetaka Miyazaki Watches Twitch Plays Dark Souls






For our October cover story on Dark Souls III, we visited From Software to speak with the series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki about his career and how the team is approaching the third game. While we were there, we also booted up the steam of Twitch playing Dark Souls to get the acclaimed designer's raw impressions of the bizarre hive-mind playthrough. While the Twitch players have now beaten one of the most difficult bosses in the game, we visited the studio a while ago and so the captured stream footage is from August 21st. We should also note that Miyazaki will not allow his voice to be captured or video footage to be taken of him, so the audio is from his translator and the still images of Miyazaki watching the stream are the best we can do. Also, for the sake of watchability, the gameplay has been edited for shorter pauses and the chat does not accurately reflect the actions on the screen. With all of those caveats out of the way, we hope you enjoy the video! 
Watch the video below to hear Miyazaki's thoughts on the bizarre internet phenomenon of "Twitch Plays Dark Souls".

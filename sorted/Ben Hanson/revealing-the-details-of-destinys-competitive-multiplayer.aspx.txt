  Revealing The Details Of Destiny's Competitive Multiplayer






At this point I think that people understand the big picture of Bungie's Destiny, you build your own character and go on an action-packed unified journey throughout our solar system. Our goal with the January cover reveal of Destiny is to fill in some of the details on this ambitious and grandiose adventure. I sat down with Bungie's Lars Bakken, the multiplayer lead for Halo 3 and one of the creators of Firefight, to dive into details on Destiny's competitive multiplayer. Bakken stresses this in the interview as well, but we want to note that details on Bungie's design are constantly shifting so the specifics mentioned in the interview are not set in stone. If you're not interested in the competitive multiplayer aspect of the game, you can learn much more about the gameplay of Destiny by reading the latest issue of Game Informer, which you can read right now through your subscription to digital.
Watch the video below to learn about how the competitive multiplayer works within the world, new details on health and voice chat, and how the game's feel compares to Halo.

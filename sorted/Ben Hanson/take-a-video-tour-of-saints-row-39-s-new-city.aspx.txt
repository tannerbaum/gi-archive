You may have already seen Volition discuss the design philosophy behind the new city in Saints Row: The Third, but now's your chance to see the city of Steelport under construction. Meet Jonathan Schmidt, lead terrain artist for Saints Row: The Third. His job is to take the concepts and designs from the rest of the team and turn them into a concrete world for the player. Armed with Volition's new "CTG" world editor, Jonathan is able to quickly change the world on the fly and craft the ultimate open-world experience. Check out the video below to see what the city of Steelport has in store for players of Saints Row: The Third.

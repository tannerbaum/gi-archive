  Creating The Story Of Middle-earth: Shadow Of Mordor






The cover story for the December issue of Game Informer features the gigantic new action game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, you can read about all aspects of the game by checking out the digital version of the magazine. Instead of basing the game on the Lord of the Rings or Hobbit trilogies, Monolith Productions is adding to Tolkien's universe by creating a new story set in pre-War of the Ring Mordor. Treading new ground in this revered world can be difficult, but luckily the narrative is being spear-headed by two gigantic Tolkien fans: Director of design Michael de Plater and lead writer Christian Cantamessa. Cantamessa was one of the lead developers and writers on Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption and Monolith Productions is hoping to tap into his wealth of knowledge to bring the chaotic world of Mordor to life.
Watch the video interview below to hear de Plater and Cantamessa talk about the lessons from Red Dead Redemption and the overview for protagonist Talion's journey across the changing lands of Mordor.

  Remedy's Sam Lake On The Magic Of VR






Last month we unveiled a month of exclusive coverage on Remedy Entertainment's upcoming Xbox One-exclusive Quantum Break. As part of a conversation with that game's creative director Sam Lake on the future of interactive storytelling, we talked about the potential for virtual reality in the game industry. 
As an independent studio, Remedy always has an eye on exciting developments and new markets for games. They have a small team dedicated to mobile games and Lake expressed an interest in creating a similar team for exploring the world of VR.
Watch the video interview below to hear Sam Lake talk about the striking level of enthusiasm among developers for creating games in VR.

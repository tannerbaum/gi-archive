  A New Beginning: Designing Infamous Second Son






In addition to taking the leap to the next console generation, the developers at Sucker Punch Productions are exploring within the Infamous universe by putting players in charge of a new protagonist named Delsin Rowe. Armed with smoke-controlling powers in the open-world environment of Seattle, Delsin's introduction to players is assisted by Sucker Punch's new designer (formerly of Bungie) named Jaime Griesemer.

  Exclusive Combat Gameplay And Details For The Outer Worlds






            With our new cover story on Obsidian's The Outer Worlds, we're rolling out exclusive features and videos throughout the month. For the video above, we spoke with the game's co-director Tim Cain and lead designer Charles Staples about their approach to combat.

Watch the interview above to see plenty of new combat gameplay and learn how the team at Obsidian balanced shooting action with RPG elements.

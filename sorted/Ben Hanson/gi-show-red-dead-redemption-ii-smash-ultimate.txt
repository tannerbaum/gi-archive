  GI Show – Red Dead Redemption II, Smash Ultimate, Darksiders III Interview






            Game Informer's Ben Hanson, Ben Reeves, Matt Miller, Elise Favis, Matt Bertz, Jeff Cork, and Leo Vader all gather around the campfire to debate Rockstar's incredibly bold approach with the design of Red Dead Redemption 2 and break down the highlights from the PlayStation Classic line-up. Then Kyle Hilliard, Suriel Vazquez, and Imran Khan join the show to talk about the final Nintendo Direct on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Switch and also Toby Fox's surprising follow-up to Undertale called Deltarune. Then after some great community emails, we're joined by Gunfire Games' David Adams to talk about his past with Vigil Games and designing Darksiders III.

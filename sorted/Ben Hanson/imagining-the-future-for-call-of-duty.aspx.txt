  Imagining The Future For Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare






With Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Sledgehammer Games is branching out from its predecessors and creating an entirely new universe for the series. Studio heads Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey wanted to create a futuristic world set in the year 2054, but one that can't be described as "sci-fi". We spoke with Schofield and Condrey about the challenges of creating a vision of the future from scratch and what it means for the Call of Duty franchise.
Watch the interview below to learn what separates this version of the future from Black Ops 2 and what they have in mind for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2.

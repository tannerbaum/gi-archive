  The Storyline Of Batman: Arkham Origins






With this year's upcoming release of Batman: Arkham Origins, the new team at Warner Bros. Games Montreal is winding back the clock on the Arkham series and investigating Batman's early years in Gotham. Guided by Geoff Johns and the rest of DC Comics, the new game is being written by Dooma Wendschuch and Corey May of Sekretagent Productions, the team behind games such as Assassin's Creed and the earlier Army of Two entries.
Watch the video below to hear creative director Eric Holmes and narrative director/writer Dooma Wendschuch talk about creating a less polished Batman, his relationship with both Alfred and Penguin, the Christmas setting, and how they were inspired by classic comic books such asÂ Batman: Year One.

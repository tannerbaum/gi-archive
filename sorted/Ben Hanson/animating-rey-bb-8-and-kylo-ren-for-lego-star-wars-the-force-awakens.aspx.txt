  Animating Rey, BB-8, And Kylo Ren For Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens






For Game Informer's March cover story on Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we visited developer TT Fusion in Wilmslow, England to get a sneak peak at how the team is putting the game together. Previously working on animated films such as Corpse Bride, TT Fusion's head of animation Matt Palmer has been working on Lego games for nine years now and knows a thing or two about bringing Lego characters to life. We spoke to Palmer about the process of Lego-ifying and animating the characters from Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Watch the video below to learn how the team at TT Fusion is bringing characters like Rey, BB-8, and Kylo Ren to life in the next Lego game.

  Star Wars To Mob Wars – The Career Of Mafia III's Haden Blackman






With our month of coverage on Mafia III, we've shown you gameplay and talked about the difficult process of founding of the new studio. Now we're taking a deep dive into the career of the game's creative director, Haden Blackman. With 13 years at LucasArts, Blackman worked with external developers in the process of creating Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Galaxies before becoming the creative director for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. 
We spoke to Blackman about the pros and cons of working for LucasArts during that era, his work in comics and the free-to-play space after LucasArts, and what lessons he took from George Lucas that he's applying to Mafia III.

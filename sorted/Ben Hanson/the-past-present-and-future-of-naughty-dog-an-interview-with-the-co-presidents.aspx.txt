  New Tricks: An Interview With Naughty Dog's Co-Presidents






Naughty Dog has always been a studio about teamwork. Originally founded by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, the duo expertly guided the company until their departure in 2004, when they made room for Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra to take the helm and become co-presidents of the legendary studio. Game Informer editor-in-chief Andy McNamara sat down with the co-presidents to talk about their history, the studio's emphasis on storytelling, and what it has been like to hand the reins of a second team over to Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann for the Last of Us.

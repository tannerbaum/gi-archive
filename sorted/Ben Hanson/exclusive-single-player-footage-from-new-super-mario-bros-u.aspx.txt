  Exclusive Single-Player Footage From New Super Mario Bros. U






Nintendo has been making a big push to emphasize the multiplayer potential of the Wii U, but players are welcome to explore the Mushroom Kingdom on their own in New Super Mario Bros. U. Free from the shackles of his gangly brother Luigi and the Toads, Mario has nobody to push him off a ledge or refuse to pop his bubble in this newly released video. Watch the trailer below to see new environments, the mini mushroom, and some of Yoshi's new abilities in action.

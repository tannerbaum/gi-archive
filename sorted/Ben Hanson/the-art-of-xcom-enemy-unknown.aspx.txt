  The Art Of XCOM: Enemy Unknown






After years of creating barbarians and Mahatma Ghandis for the Civilization series, art director Greg Foertsch was given the task of reimagining the look of X-COM. Shedding the original's Saturday-morning-graphic-novel look for one of slightly stylized "miniatures", Greg Foertsch and his team of artists have pored over the details of everything from the insectoids to the Skyranger. Check out the video below to see concept art and screens from the game and to learn more about how the new game takes advantage of an active camera.
In addition, we've got three more screenshots from the game in the media gallery below for your viewing pleasure.

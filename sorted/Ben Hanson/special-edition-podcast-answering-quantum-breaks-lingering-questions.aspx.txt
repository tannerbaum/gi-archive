  Answering Quantum Break's Lingering Questions






We're nearing the end of our month of exclusive coverage for Remedy Entertainment's Quantum Break, and we gave the community a chance to ask the developers anything that was on their mind. On this special edition of The Game Informer Show, Ben Reeves and I Skyped with Quantum Break's creative director Sam Lake and PR director Thomas Puha to answer the community's burning questions about Quantum Break. 
We talk about the finer points of Remedy's upcoming Xbox One game, the odds of an Alan Wake remaster, what the team thought of Rockstar's Max Payne 3, and more! Enjoy the show!

  Meet Final Fantasy XV's Legendary Composer






You might not know the name Yoko Shimomura, but you should. Shimomura is one of the most prolific and influential composers in the game industry, whose resume includes classics like Street Fighter II, Super Mario RPG, Kingdom Hearts, Xenoblade Chronicles, and much more. She started working on this project back when it was called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, and now she's found herself tackling the music for the next numbered Final Fantasy. While visiting Square Enix for our extensive cover story on Final Fantasy XV, we sat down with Shimomura to discuss the secrets behind her writing process, what she's learned from Nobuo Uematsu, and what she has in mind for the musical tone of Final Fantasy XV.
Watch the interview below to see new gameplay and learn all about the talent behind Final Fantasy XV's music.

  Star Wars Meets Disney: Designing Infinity's New Toys






Jeff Bunker never thought he would be a toy designer. As vice president of art development within Avalanche Software, the rise of Disney Infinity has forced him to become an expert on designing and manufacturing millions of figures. While visiting the studio for our cover story on Disney Infinity 3.0, we spoke to Bunker about creating the series' signature style and the difficulty of reimagining the Star Wars universe through that lens.
We journey back to the early days of Disney Infinity (to a time when it might have involved magnetic swappable body parts) before breaking down the new Star Wars characters and learning which actor was the toughest to adapt. If you keep your eyes peeled, the video even shows off some new gameplay footage from Disney Infinity 3.0.
Please watch the video below as Jeff Bunker and members of his design team take us behind the scenes on creating the Star Wars figures for Disney Infinity 3.0.

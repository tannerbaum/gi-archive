  GI Show – Red Dead Redemption 2, PlayStation Classic, Spider-Man Game Club Part 2






            Game Informer's Ben Hanson, Jeff Cork, and Matt Bertz share gameplay impressions of playing Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2. Brian Shea and Matt Bertz also talk about playing NHL 19 and the excellent NBA 2K19. Then we dive back in time and talk about the announcement of the PlayStation Classic and playing old NES games through the Nintendo Switch Online. We also cover the latest Nintendo Direct featuring Luigi's Mansion 3 and Animal Crossing and Valkyria Chronicles 4. After some great community emails, we dive in deep on the middle section of Insomniac's Spider-Man on the PlayStation 4 with our GI Game Club.

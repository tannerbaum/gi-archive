  GI Show – Final Fantasy XV Impressions, Oddworld's Lorne Lanning






It's an exciting episode of The Game Informer Show this week. Host Ben Hanson is joined by Joe Juba to talk about our trip to Square Enix and to share our exclusive impressions of playing Final Fantasy XV. After that Kyle Hilliard explains how he fell in love with Hyper Light Drifter and why it was specifically crafted in a lab for his tastes in gaming. Then Andrew Reiner shares his thoughts on the impressive, new reboot of Ratchet & Clank. The back half of the show this week features Lorne Lanning from Oddworld Inhabitants to talk about the upcoming "remake" of Abe's Exoddus, the intersection of Hollywood and games, and his concerns about the booming VR industry.

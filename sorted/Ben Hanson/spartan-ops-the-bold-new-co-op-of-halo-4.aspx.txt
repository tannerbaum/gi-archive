  Spartan Ops: The Bold New Co-Op Of Halo 4 






In the second story for our week of multiplayer coverage we want to introduce and detail one of the largest new additions to the Halo package: the co-op mode called Spartan Ops. Broken up into seasons, these weekly doses of videos coupled with missions attempt to bring Halo fans back to the game on a regular basis, and give campaign players a reason to engage with the new narrative-focused multiplayer experience. Watch the video below to hear creative director Josh Holmes and lead Spartan Ops designer Chris Haluke explain the new mode and how they hope it will offer an inviting entrance into the integrated multiplayer world of Halo 4.

  Exploring The Deadly World Of Mad Max






If you've played Just Cause 2 from Avalanche Studios, you understand the team's passion for creating gigantic worlds for players to explore. With their new game, Mad Max, players will be set loose in the Wasteland (which kinda sorta isn't Australia) and tasked with finding the resources to create their ideal customizable death car. We spoke with game director Frank Rooke and lead artist Daniel Persson about the process of designing this brutal environment and what you'll encounter in the final game.
Watch the video interview below to learn what features and enemies Mad Max will come across in the Wasteland.

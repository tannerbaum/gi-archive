  Annualization, VR, And The Future Of Resident Evil






Our cover story is on Resident Evil Revelations 2 this month, but we also wanted to focus a bit on the direction of the overall series and what the future holds. When visiting Japan to play Resident Evil Revelations 2, we spoke with its producer, Michiteru Okabe, and also the producer of the Resident Evil HD remake, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, about the evolving landscape of survival horror games. Game Informer's Tim Turi, also known as our resident Resident Evil expert, asked specifically about competition like Silent Hills and The Evil Within, the pros and cons of annualizing the series, the potential of VR and horror, and what direction the development team is hoping to take on the next numbered entry.
Watch the video interview below to learn all about the future of Resident Evil from producers Okabe and Hirabayashi.

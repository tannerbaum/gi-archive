  Unravelling The Secrets Of Dark Souls Creator Hidetaka Miyazaki






If you watched our previous video with the creator of Dark Souls Hidetaka Miyazaki, you might have been confused about the format: Miyazaki doesn't allow himself to be filmed or his voice recorded. To try and get to the bottom of the mysterious creator and the reasons why he prefers to be shrouded in secrecy, we spoke with From Software's senior managing director Masanori Takeuchi. Takeuchi has worked with Miyazaki since the latter started at From Software and has watched his meteoric rise through the ranks. We spoke with Masanori about the history of the studio for an upcoming video, but this interview segment is an attempt to unravel the secrets of Hidetaka Miyazaki. Also, we should point out that due to poor audio quality in the recording, the translator's voice has been dubbed over by Game Informer's Jeff Cork. Jeff does not actually speak Japanese.
Watch the video below to learn more about the creator of Dark Souls from one of his oldest co-workers.

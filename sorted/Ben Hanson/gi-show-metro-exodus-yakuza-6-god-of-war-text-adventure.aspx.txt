  GI Show – Metro Exodus, Yakuza 6, God Of War Text Adventure






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! We have an ambitious, new episode for you today. First up, Matt Bertz and Javy Gwaltney share a ton of new details on Metro Exodus from our recent cover story trip to visit the studio in Malta. Bertz also explains why he's so intrigued by Hunt: Showdown and how every podcast listener is invited to join us at Fulton Brewery in Minneapolis, Minnesota to celebrate Game Informer's 300th issue. Jeff Cork, Leo Vader, and Imran Khan geek out about the promising Yakuza 6  for a while before we get to some great emails from the community. The back half of the show gets bizarre, with a new crew and our resident D&D DM expert Matt Miller "playing" the new God of War text adventure game called God of War - A Call From the Wilds. It's wild. We hope you enjoy the episode, and please tell a friend if you do!

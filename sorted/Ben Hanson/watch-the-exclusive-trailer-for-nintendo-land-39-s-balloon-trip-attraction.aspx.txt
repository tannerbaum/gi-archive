  Watch The Exclusive Trailer For Nintendo Land's Balloon Trip Attraction






While the Wii U launch title Nintendo Land contains attractions centered around more notable franchises like Donkey Kong and Zelda, the latest attraction to be revealed is based on the 1986 NES title Balloon Fight. Largely ignored aside from a sequel on the Game Boy called Balloon Kid, a 3D mini-game in Wario Ware: Smooth Moves, and the game's fantastic music in Super Smash Bros., Nintendo has blown out the neglected game's original Balloon Trip mode into a stand-out game within Nintendo Land. With a graphical style similar to Kirby's Epic Yarn, Balloon Trip Breeze has players swiping the stylus on the GamePad to keep the balloon-strapped Mii aloft and dodging obstacles. While Balloon Trip Breeze is a single-player experience, Nintendo has yet to reveal whether Nintendo Land also contains a Balloon Fight-inspired multiplayer game. Watch the video below to see the game in action.

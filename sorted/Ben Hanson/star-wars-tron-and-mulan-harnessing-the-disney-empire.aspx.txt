  Star Wars, Tron, And Iron Fist: Harnessing The Disney Empire






Disney has had a long and sometimes scattered history with games. While visiting Avalanche Software for our June cover story on Disney Infinity 3.0, we sat down with the vice president of production for Disney Infinity, John Vignocchi, to learn more about Disney Interactive's approach to gaming and the shift in priorities toward Disney Infinity. Trying to channel the entire Disney empire into the most efficient content for the Disney Infinity series is a monumental task, and we wanted to talk to Vignocchi about the moving parts involved behind the scenes.
Watch the interview below to learn more about what the Star Wars purchase meant for Disney Infinity and how the team maps out the future of the series.

  GI Show – Detroit, Labo's Verdict, God Of War Game Club






Game Informer's Ben Hanson, Kimberley Wallace, and Jeff Cork start the show by debating whether or not David Cage and Quantic Dream can pull off some of the deep and sensitive themes surrounding Detroit: Become Human on PlayStation 4. Kyle Hilliard joins the show to weigh in with his full thoughts on Nintendo Labo's cardboard adventures, Matt Bertz to talk about the brutal survival/sim Frostpunk from 11 Bit Studios, and Dan Tack stops by to talk about BattleTech and MechWarrior fun. After some great community emails, we kick off a gigantic community discussion about the first half of Sony Santa Monica's God of War.

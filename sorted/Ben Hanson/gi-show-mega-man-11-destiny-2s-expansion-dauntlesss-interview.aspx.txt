  GI Show – Mega Man 11, Destiny 2's Expansion, Dauntlesss Interview






On this episode of The Game Informer Show, Ben Hanson, Joe Juba, Suriel Vazquez, and Ben Reeves share exclusive hands-on impressions of playing Capcom's Mega Man 11 and discuss the game alongside special Capcom guest (and former GI Show co-host) Tim Turi. Then Matt Miller joins us to talk about Bungie's new expansion for Destiny 2 called Curse of Osiris. After some great community emails, and a red-hot review of the new Super Mario cereal, we're joined by Ian Tornay and Nick Clifford from Phoenix Labs to talk about the creation of Dauntless, its inspirations from games like Monster Hunter, and the messy launch of Mass Effect 3.

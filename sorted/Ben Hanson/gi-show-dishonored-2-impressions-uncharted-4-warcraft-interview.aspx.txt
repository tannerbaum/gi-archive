  GI Show – Dishonored 2 Impressions, Uncharted 4, Warcraft Interview






It's one of those exciting weeks on The Game Informer Show, with the announcement of our next cover story and unloading our thoughts on one of the year's biggest releases. This week on the show, host Ben Hanson is joined by Matt Bertz and Ben Reeves to talk about the trip out to France to see Dishonored 2 in action and our upcoming month of coverage. After that, Andrew Reiner joins us to gush about his time reviewing Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and explains why it's a great end to the series. We touch on a few smaller games like Push Me Pull You and the impressive Stephen's Sausage Roll before speaking with the director of the upcoming Warcraft film Duncan Jones, who you might know from his excellent work on films like Moon and Source Code.

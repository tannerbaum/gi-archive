  Submit Your Questions For Our The Outer Worlds Podcast Interview






            All month long we've been rolling out exclusive features on The Outer Worlds, hopefully we've answered a lot of your questions about the game but we wanted to give the community once last chance to have their most burning questions answered. In an upcoming episode of The Game Informer Show podcast, we're Skyping in the game's co-directors Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky.

Leave a comment below with your question for Cain and Boyarsky about Obsidian's The Outer Worlds or their long history developing games like Fallout or Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines

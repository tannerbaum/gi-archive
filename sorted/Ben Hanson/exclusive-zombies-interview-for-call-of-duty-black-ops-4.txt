  Exclusive Zombies Interview For Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4






            With our latest cover story on Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, we've been rolling out exclusive features on Blackout and the game's multiplayer. This week, we wanted to finally cater to fans of the zombies mode. While we've shared quick impressions of what we learned about zombies while visiting Treyarch on The Game Informer Show, the video above has the director of Zombies Jason Blundell sharing his thoughts on Black Ops 4's bold approach to the mode this year. The team is starting up a new storyline they're calling the Chaos story, the first new chapter for Treyarch zombies after the Aether tale's longstanding (and still going!) 10+ year run. We hope you enjoy the interview!

  Exclusive Interview On Dragon Ball FighterZ’s Story Mode






With our new cover story on Dragon Ball FighterZ, we've shown a lot of new gameplay and looked deep into the game's combat, but much of the story still remains a mystery. We spoke with the game's director, Junya Motomura, and its producer, Tomoko Hiroki, about what players can expect from the narrative. In the interview, Motomura and Hiroki share more about Android 21, detail in ambiguous terms the bizarre premise that has the player taking over Goku's body, and what elements of the Android Saga will serve as an influence on the narrative.

  Designing The Stark Tower Level in Lego Marvel Super Heroes






With a healthy mix of action and puzzles, the Lego games have refined their level design with every new game. The wealth of characters in Lego Marvel Super Heroes gives the designers plenty of options when designing puzzles and obstacles for the player to overcome. While visiting Traveller's Tales in England for the cover story, we spoke to assistant game director Steve Sharples about Lego level design and how they created the stage based on Stark Tower.
Watch the video below to see an early version of the game in action and to learn more about Captain America and Tony Stark's journey through the iconic Marvel building.

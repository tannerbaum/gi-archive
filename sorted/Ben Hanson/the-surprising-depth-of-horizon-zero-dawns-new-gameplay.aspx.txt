  The Surprising Depth Of Horizon Zero Dawn's New Gameplay






To go alongside ourÂ October cover story on Horizon Zero Dawn from Guerilla Games, we're going to be rolling out a month of exclusive content covering this PlayStation 4-exclusive action RPG. We visited the team at their studio in Amsterdam and spoke with the game's director Mathijs de Jonge about his hopes that Horizon Zero Dawn will challenge players and force them to think strategically. The interview also covers how different tribes throughout the world will affect the way you play, the variety of environments, and the critical role of emergent gameplay in this open world. Guerilla Games wanted to note that the new footage in the video is still a work-in-progress and represents pre-release gameplay.
Watch the video below to see more of Horizon Zero Dawn and learn about what it'll be like to get your hands on the game.

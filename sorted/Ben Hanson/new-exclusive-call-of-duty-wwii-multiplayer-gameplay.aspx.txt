  New, Exclusive Call Of Duty: WWII Multiplayer Gameplay






With Call of Duty: WWII's upcoming public beta, players will get to experience new multiplayer maps like Gibraltar. But, before you dive in, you might be able to learn a thing or two from this new gameplay footage where a pro shows off the new map. While visiting Sledgehammer Games for ourÂ new cover story on Call of Duty: WWII, we were able to capture gameplay footage from one of the best Call of Duty: WWII players in the world that now works within the studio on the multiplayer design team. We'd love to tell you this hero's identity, but Activision isn't ready to reveal the hire yet.
Watch the video below to see new gameplay footage from Gibraltar, Pointe du Hoc, Ardennes Forest, and the War mode with Operation Breakout.

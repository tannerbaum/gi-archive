  The Secret Details Behind Metro Exodus' New Guns






With Game Informer's newÂ cover story on Metro Exodus, we cover a lot of ground and explain the biggest changes that the series is making with the upcoming sequel. One of the most interesting aspects of previous games are the guns. This time around, not only will players be given more crafting options and the ability to clean their weapons this time around, but the team at 4A Games is going above and beyond to ensure that the weapons could be built in the real world. One of the leading voices in the visual direction of the game's guns is art director Sergei "Karma" Karmalsky. While visiting the studio in Malta, we spoke with Karma about the full creative process behind making new guns and how the new arsenal compares to Metro: Last Light's.
Watch the interview with Karma below to see some of the new guns in action.

  GI Show – Control, Devil May Cry 5, Glen Schofield Interview






            Welcome back to The Game Informer Show podcast! On this week's episode, we have a mountain of games to discuss. First up, we're sharing exclusive details from our new cover story on Remedy's Control. Then we gather together our stylish-action experts to share their final verdict on Devil May Cry 5 and more. After that, Jeff Cork talks about playing Days Gone on the PlayStation 4 for five hours and we gush about Ape Out. After some great community emails, we're joined by Glen Schofield to talk about his life after leaving Sledgehammer Games and Activision, and what he'd like to see from a sequel to Dead Space.

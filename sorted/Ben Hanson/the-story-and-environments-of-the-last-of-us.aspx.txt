  The Story And Environments Of The Last Of Us






With the release of Uncharted 3 behind them, the next creation to leave the hallowed halls of Naughty Dog is an original game called The Last of Us. The team at the Santa Monica-based studio has spent the last two years creating an entirely new world. The game is a post-apocalyptic tale about survival, but the team at Naughty Dog hopes that the journey of the main characters and the green environments will help them stand apart from anything you've seen before. The game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann are putting a heavy emphasis on the story, and now is your chance to learn how that story begins. Watch the video below to hear about the early portions of the game and what kind of environments Joel and Ellie will be exploring as they strike out on their adventure. The creative team also addresses the idea of a potential sequel to this story.

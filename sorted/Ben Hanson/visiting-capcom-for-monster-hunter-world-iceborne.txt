  Visiting Capcom For Monster Hunter World: Iceborne






            By now we hope you've noticed we've been rolling out exclusive features on Monster Hunter World: Iceborne throughout July. We hope you learned new details about the game – thanks for following along! To close things out, we have a much lighter and sillier video we put together highlighting our trip overseas. Watch the travelogue above to see Jeff Cork and me journey through the delightful streets of Osaka, Japan and make a brief visit to South Korea.

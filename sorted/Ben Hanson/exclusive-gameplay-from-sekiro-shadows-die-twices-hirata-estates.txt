  Exclusive Gameplay From Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice's Hirata Estates






            With Game Informer's new cover story on From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, we're diving in deep and sharing everything we learned about Hidetaka Miyazaki's next game. During our trip to the studio, we played the game for several areas and explored a new area called Hirata Estates. The area is technically a flashback, taking place three years before the events of the main game and helps to explain Sekiro's relationship with a character known as the "young lord". Watch the video above to see new gameplay from Hirata Estates as Game Informer's Dan Tack and Suriel Vazquez explain what stood out to them.

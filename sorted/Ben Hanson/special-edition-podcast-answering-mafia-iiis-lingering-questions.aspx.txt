  Special Edition Podcast: Answering Mafia III's Lingering Questions






We've reached the end of our month of content rounding out our November cover story on Mafia III from Hangar 13. We've had features detailing gameplay, the founding of the studio, and the real-world mob presence in New Orleans, but we wanted to open the floor to the fans of the Mafia franchise out there and give them a chance to ask Mafia III's creative director Haden Blackman anything they'd like. We pulled dozens of questions from the community and Skyped in Blackman to answer questions about why the team chose such a new setting for the franchise, how the world compares to Mafia II, and which lingering questions from the franchise will be addressed.

We hope you enjoy the special edition podcast below, and be sure to tune in on Thursday for the regularly scheduled Game Informer Show! You can listen to the episode below orÂ subscribe and listen to the audio on iTunes.

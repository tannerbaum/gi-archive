  Sledgehammer On Shifting From Advanced Warfare To Call Of Duty: WWII






Throughout the entire month, we're rolling out exclusive features covering Call of Duty: WWII to go along with our September cover story. This video focuses more on the studio behind the game and what it's been like to leave their branch of the Call of Duty series behind with Advanced Warfare and start fresh in creating Call of Duty: WWII. While visiting the studio, we spoke with studio heads Michael Condrey and Glen Schofield about the process of learning to love the creation of a historically-rooted game.

  Classic Star Wars Vs. Prequel Trilogy In Disney Infinity 3.0






While the debate about which Star Wars trilogy reigns supreme is relatively lopsided at this point, Avalanche Software was forced to rekindle the debate when deciding which trilogy's playset would come bundled with the game. During our studio visit for our June cover story on Disney Infinity 3.0, we spoke with the vice president of production for Disney Infinity, John Vignocchi, and the senior vice president and general manager of Avalanche, John Blackburn, about the factors behind their decision.

  GI Show – Breath Of The Wild Impressions, Morrowind, For Honor Interview






This week we were happy to announce that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild graces the cover of Game Informer's March issue and we're excited to talk about our extended time playing the game on the Nintendo Switch. Ben Hanson is joined by Kyle Hilliard and Ben Reeves to talk all about what stood out and impressed us about playing Link's next adventure. Then we're joined by Javy Gwaltney and Dan Tack to debate the quality of Fire Emblem Heroes on mobile and talk about Dan Tack's trip to ZeniMax Online to learn all about The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind. After some great community emails, we're joined by Ubisoft Montreal's Jason VandenBerghe to talk about what it's like to be the creative director of the studio's new IP For Honor.

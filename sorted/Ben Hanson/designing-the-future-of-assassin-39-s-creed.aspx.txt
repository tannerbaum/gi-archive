  Designing The Future Of Assassin's Creed






We hope you've enjoyed our month of coverage on Assassin's Creed Rogue and Unity, and we're closing things out with a look to the future. While visiting Ubisoft Montreal for our cover story, we spoke with the creative director and brand content manager for the series, Jean Guesdon, about the team's road map for the next generation of games. Guesdon hints at plans to expand even more into the online capabilities of the new consoles and why Abstergo Entertainment will make its return in Unity, eliminating the concept of a playable character that's separate from the player for the present-day sections. 
Watch the video interview below to learn more about planning for the future of the Assassin's Creed series, how they're creating the "first real-time trans-media universe," and what Guesdon sees as the biggest threat to the brand.

  Embracing Chaos: Far Cry 4's New Approach To Narrative






The team at Ubisoft Montreal is very proud of Far Cry 3 (with good reason), but the lead developers of Far Cry 4 are focused on improving this game's narrative. Far Cry 3 fell into controversy surrounding racial tropes and a significant disconnect between the player's experience and the motivations of protagonist Jason Brody. Mark Thompson is stepping up from the role of level-design director with Far Cry 3 to narrative director in Far Cry 4, leading the charge to better integrate the open-world experience with the game's storyline. While much of the team from the last game is in place, there is a new creative director and lead writer at the helm for the fourth entry and they are eager to correct any narrative missteps from Far Cry 3.Â 
Watch the video interview below to learn more about the team's approach to creating a more relatable protagonist, safeguarding against any racial or cultural insensitivity, and whether Blood Dragon's warm reception helped shape the story of Far Cry 4.

With Game Informer's new cover story on Infinity Ward's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, we want to revive our GI Game Club format and go back for a thorough look at 2007's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.

On the August 15th episode of The Game Informer Show podcast, we'll be playing though and discussing the entire campaign for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. We want the community to play the game along with us and send in your thoughts to podcast@gameinformer.com to help fuel the conversation! We're looking for specific points and thoughts, including...

- What's your favorite moment in the game?

- What is a specific detail you noticed in your playthrough?

- What made this game stand out among its competition in 2007?

- Why is Captain Price so beloved?

- How well has the game aged?

- Which helicopter crash was the best?

We welcome any and all emails, including if you want to write in about multiplayer, we just ask that your email be focused, specific, and fun/interesting to read on the podcast. Remember, please send your emails in to podcast@gameinformer.com before August 14 so we have time to include it on the episode.

There are several ways to play the game at this point. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered was available in March as a free PS Plus game so you might already own it. The original game is also backwards compatible on an Xbox One, and both old and new versions are available on Steam. Hell, you're welcome to play the Wii or DS versions and write in about those.

Subscribe to The Game Informer Show podcast and get ready for a fun deep dive on one of the most influential games of all time on August 15th. Check out our Game Club discussions on Spider-Man, God of War, BioShock, and more to get a better understanding of the format. We look forward to hearing your thoughts!

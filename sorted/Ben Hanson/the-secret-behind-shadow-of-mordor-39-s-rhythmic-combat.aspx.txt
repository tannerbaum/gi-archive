  The Secret Behind Shadow Of Mordor's Rhythmic Combat






Few game studios have a dedicated composer working within their walls. Senior composer Nathan Grigg has worked alongside director of audio Brian Pamintuan at Monolith Productions for over a decade and their collaborative work style is readily apparent in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. The demo of the game that we saw while visiting the studio for our December cover story did a great job of subtly adding musical stings to the most impactful moments of the game's free-flow combat. This confluence of sound design and music in the game really adds to the experience, and we hope its origins make more sense when you see Grigg and Pamintuan work together in the video.
Watch the video below to hear samples of music from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and watch the audio team at Monolith put on an improvised concert with Game Informer's Matt Miller with some of their stranger instruments. Just in case it isn't obvious from the video, the music in the game sounds a lot better than the loose musical performance at the end. Enjoy!

  GI Show – Dragon Quest XI, Cyberpunk Reactions, Game Music Trivia






            Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this episode, Ben Hanson, Andrew Reiner, and Kimberley Wallace talk about the review for Square-Enix's Dragon Quest XI: Echoes Of An Elusive Age. Javy Gwaltney, Brian Shea, and Kyle Hilliard talk about The Messenger, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate on Nintendo Switch, and Donut County. Then Jeff Cork, Suriel Vazquez, and Ben Reeves regale us with their trip to Gamescom and some of the exciting games we missed last week. After some great community emails with plenty of Cyberpunk 2077 discussion, we pit Brian Shea against Suriel Vazquez in trivia based on video game music.

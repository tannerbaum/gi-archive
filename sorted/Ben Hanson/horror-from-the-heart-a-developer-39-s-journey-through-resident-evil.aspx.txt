  Horror From The Heart – A Developer's Journey Through Resident Evil






We've had plenty of interviews with Western game developers focusing on their careers, but we rarely get the opportunity peek across the Pacfic and gain insight into Japanese development. While visiting Tokyo for our cover story on Resident Evil Revelations 2, we spoke with the producer of the HD version of the Resident Evil remake both about the game and his long career in game development. For the last twelve years, Hirabayashi has had a front row seat to watch the Resident Evil series evolve from the remake of the original game all the way to Resident Evil 6. Game Informer's Tim Turi spoke with Hirabyashi about getting into the industry, what he's learned from the creator of Resident Evil Shinji Mikami throughout the years, and what it was like to develop the beloved Resident Evil 4.
Watch the video interview below to learn what it's like to spend over a decade working on a classic series and to hear a lively debate about the best pistol in Resident Evil 4.

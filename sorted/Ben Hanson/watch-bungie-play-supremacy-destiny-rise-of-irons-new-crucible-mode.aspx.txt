  Revealing Supremacy: Exclusive Gameplay Of Destiny's New PvP Mode






With our month of coverage on Bungie's Destiny: Rise of Iron, we've shown you plenty of gameplay from the campaign and PvE content but now we want to show off the new crucible mode Supremacy. While visiting the studio we were able to capture several rounds of the new mode played by Bungie's senior multiplayer designer Leif Johansen. Supremacy tasks Guardians with scoring points by picking up "crests" that fall after a player is killed. Players can also pick up crests dropped by their fallen teammates, robbing the enemy team of potential points. It's a core concept that should be familiar to players who have ever enjoyed a match of Call of Duty's Kill Confirmed. 
Check out the video below to see Supremacy in action on three of Destiny: Rise of Iron's new maps, and don't miss today's other big Destiny news: Bungie just announced the existence of private matches.Â

  Horizon Zero Dawn's Lead Writer On The Game's Big Mysteries






With our October cover story on Horizon Zero Dawn from Guerrilla Games, we're pulling back the curtain all month long on the creation of this bold new world for players. While visiting the studio, Game Informer's Kimberley Wallace sat down with the game's lead writer John Gonzalez to learn more about the process of developing Aloy's motivations and a coherent logic to this land infested with robotic dinosaurs. To learn more about Guerrilla's challenges developing this game and leaving Killzone's gameplay behind, you can check out our other video feature on the game's origins.
Watch the interview below to learn about Aloy's childhood, the different tribes you encounter, and why you might want to read Guns, Germs, and Steel.

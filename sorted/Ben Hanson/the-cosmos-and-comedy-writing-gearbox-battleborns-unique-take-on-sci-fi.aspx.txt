  The Comedic Cosmos: Writing Battleborn's Unique Take On Sci-Fi






One of Gearbox's most noticeable hires during the development of Borderlands 2 was lead writer Anthony Burch. Not only did he prove his talents for comedy with his web series Hey Ash Watcha Playin'?, but before joining Gearbox he also contributed to Destructoid's podcast alongside reviews editor Aaron Linde. After the success of Borderlands 2, Gearbox is hoping to strike comedic gold twice by hiring Burch's old friend and co-worker Aaron Linde as the lead writer for Battleborn. Linde has contributed to the writing of big games like Gears of War 3 and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, but he is now spearheading Gearbox's bold new IP Battleborn. While visiting Gearbox for our August cover story on Battleborn, Game Informer's Tim Turi sat down with Linde to talk about his history with Burch, the appeal of "big question sci-fi", and the key to writing comedic battle chatter in a game.
Watch the video interview below to learn more about the inspirations and thought processes behind Gearbox's comedic take on the end of the universe.

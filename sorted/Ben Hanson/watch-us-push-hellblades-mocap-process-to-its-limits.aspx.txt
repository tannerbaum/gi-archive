  Watch Us Push Hellblade's Mocap Process To Its Limits






With our new cover story on Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, we're shining a spotlight on the innovative work from the developers of Heavenly Sword, Enslaved, and DmC. Ninja Theory has long been known for being on the forefront of motion-capture technology, going back to the early days of the PS3 when it worked with Andy Serkis on Heavenly Sword. In an effort to make the entire mocap process faster and cheaper, in the hopes of selling their games for less to consumers, creative director Tameem Antoniades and the team converted a meeting room into a full mocap studio and has emphasized capturing performances in real time. It's important to note that only a handful of scenes in Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice were recorded with the real-time process shown off in the video, but the studio hopes to use it more in the future. If you're interested in learning more about Ninja Theory's process of building an internal mocap studio, watch their informative dev diary videos on the process.
Watch the video below to see Game Informer's Ben Reeves bring pure absurdity to the process alongside Melina Juergens, the actress that plays Senua in the game.

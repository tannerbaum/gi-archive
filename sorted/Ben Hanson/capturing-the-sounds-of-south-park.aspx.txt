  Capturing The Sounds Of South Park






The voices of Matt Stone and Trey Parker have become synonymous with comedic gold. A majority of the voices in South Park are performed by the two creators and the same will hold true for South Park: The Game.
 Obsidian Entertainment's audio director Scott Lawlor is in charge of not just implementing the iconic voices into the game, but also the sound effects and music. To ensure that the game sounds exactly like the show, the team at South Park Studios is opening the doors and sharing all of South Park's audio resources, including the show's composer and entire catalog of music. Check out the video below to hear samples and learn more about the working relationship between the audio team at Obsidian Entertainment and South Park Studios.

  Exclusive Look At The Kett, Mass Effect Andromeda's New Race






Mass Effect fans that watched the latest trailer with a close eye probably noticed several cryptic shots of a new alien race. This feature aims to go even further in-depth than our cover story on BioWare's Mass Effect Andromeda in the grand reveal of BioWare's new alien race for the Andromeda galaxy called the Kett. While visiting BioWare Montreal, we sat down with Mass Effect Andromeda's art director Joel MacMillan to walk through the development process of inventing a brand new alien species for the beloved series. If you enjoy this look into the process, check out our earlier videos that take a similar deep dive into the development of the Asari, Krogan, Salarians, and Batarians.
While BioWare wants to remain secretive about the race's full backstory and role in the plot, we hope you enjoy this thorough look at the design of the Kett.

  An Unprecedented Look At Destiny: The Taken King's Vertigo Map






Some of the greatest multiplayer maps of all time have come from the halls of Bungie, so during our month of content highlighting Destiny: The Taken King we wanted to take a deep dive into the team's approach to creating a map for the Crucible. We gathered Bungie's senior multiplayer designer Andrew Weldon and Crucible level artist Adam Williams to break down every nook and cranny of The Taken King's new Mercury map, Vertigo. Students of game design, Destiny's lore, or just fans of finding the best strategies in Destiny's Crucible maps should definitely not miss this video.

  GI Show – Days Gone, Pillars 2, E3's Huge Leak






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On this week's episode, Jeff Cork and Jeff Marchiafava have a lot of exclusive information to share on Days Gone based around our new cover story on the game. Matt Miller and Ben Reeves then join the show to talk about our review for Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, the Theme Hospital-inspired Two Point Hospital, and our early thoughts on Destiny 2's new expansion. We're lucky enough to also be joined by Ready at Dawn's creative director Ru Weerasuriya to talk about his team's work on the God of War games for PSP and what he thinks of Kratos' new adventure. After some great community emails, we dive in deep on the absurdly gigantic leak of a ton of games that might be at E3 2018.

  229 Rapid-Fire Questions About Dreams






            Game Informer's new cover story is on Dreams, the next game from the creators of LittleBigPlanet Media Molecule. While the game contains a story mode, the star of the show is the incredibly ambitious creation tools that allow amateurs and aspiring game developers alike to create... whatever they can imagine? Naturally, we have a lot of questions. While visiting Media Molecule, Ben Hanson sat down with the studio's co-founder Alex Evans to ask as many questions as we could about the potential of Dreams. Watch the video above and let us know what you think of his answers in the comments below!

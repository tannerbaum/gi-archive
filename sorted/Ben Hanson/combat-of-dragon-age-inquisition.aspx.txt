  Refining Tactics â€“ The Combat Of Dragon Age: Inquisition






BioWare listens to their fans. When we visited the studio for the latest cover story, the development team made it clear that a lot of their audience enjoyed the more tactical approach to combat from Dragon Age: Origins. While BioWare wouldn't confirm the return of the tactical view from that game, creative director Mike Laidlaw and executive produce Mark Darrah are pushing for more strategic encounters in Inqusition. We spoke with Laidlaw and Darrah about their vision for the next iteration of combat in the series, and senior gameplay designer Josh Stiksma showed off some pre-alpha footage.

  The New Gameplay Of Assassin's Creed Unity






While visiting Ubisoft Montreal for our September cover story on Assassin's Creed Unity and Rogue, the lead developers on the new-gen title Unity emphasized that they were reworking the core pillars of the franchise to go along with their full leap to the next generation. We spoke with creative director Alex Amancio, lead game designer Alex Pedneault, and game designer Max Spielberg about exactly what has changed in the navigation, stealth, and combat gameplay for Assassin's Creed Unity. With new controls for climbing, a renewed emphasis on stealth and open mission design, and more deliberate and difficult combat, Ubisoft is promising that the next Assassin's Creed will feel different and fix common complaints about the gameplay of previous entries.Â The video also features several never-heard music tracks from Unity, so I hope you enjoy.

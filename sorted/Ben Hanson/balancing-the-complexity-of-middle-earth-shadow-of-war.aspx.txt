  Balancing The Complexity Of Middle-earth: Shadow Of War






Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor turned a lot of heads back in 2014 for its unique take on enemy AI and systemic gameplay in an open-world action game. Now, with Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Monolith Productions is expanding on the ideas in the last game and making everything bigger, deeper, and more complex. In this video interview, we spoke with Michael de Plater about the line between systemic complexity and mass appeal. Especially with de Plater's design background in the RTS genre, we discuss the amount of strategy in the game and how to balance such a diverse experience.
Watch the video below to learn more about how "hardcore" of a game Monolith Productions is creating.

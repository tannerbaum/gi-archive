  Inside the Creation Of Warcraft III's Soundtrack






            With our new cover story on Warcraft III: Reforged, we're rolling out a month of exclusive features with some focusing less on the remake and more on the creation of the original RTS. In the video above, we interview co-composer of Warcraft III Derek Duke and his work creating the undead and orc soundtracks. We also talk about what defines the soundscape for Warcraft as a series.

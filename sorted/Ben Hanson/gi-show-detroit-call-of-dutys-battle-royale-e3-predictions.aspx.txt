  GI Show – Detroit, Call Of Duty's Battle Royale, E3 Predictions






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show! On today's episode, we're joined by a very special guest to celebrate the podcast's 400th episode and we also have a lot of great games to talk about. First up, Kimberley Wallace and Joe Juba talk about their time playing and enjoying Detroit: Become Human on the PlayStation 4. Oh, and Kim has played Kingdom Hearts III. Then Dan Tack and Suriel Vazquez join the show to talk about playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and Dark Souls Remastered. After some great community emails (with only one major video technical snafu), we break down what we know and hope for in Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft's press conferences for E3 2018.

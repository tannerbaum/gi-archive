  Exclusive Interview With Mega Man 11's Creators






This week we were excited to reveal Game Informer's January cover story is on Mega Man 11. We spent two days at Capcom's headquarters in Osaka, playing the game and speaking with the game's new development team. The two lead developers on the new game are producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya and game director Koji Oda. We sat down with Tsuchiya and Oda to figure out what Mega Man 11 means for Capcom and the team's approach to sustaining versus reinventing the series' classic gameplay.
Watch the video below to learn from Mega Man 11's lead developers what it takes to revive a classic franchise.

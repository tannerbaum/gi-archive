  The Secrets Behind Final Fantasy XV's Animation






With our month-long roll-out of coverage on Final Fantasy XV to coincide with our extensive May cover story, we've shown a lot of new gameplay from the game's opening chapter and beyond. One thing that stands out from those gameplay videos is the impressive animation work created by Final Fantasy XV's lead animator Taisuke Ooe and his team. While visiting the studio, we spoke with Ooe about the team's approach to animating such a large game, the role of mocap, and how the animation process has changed for this entry. Also, we want to note that the gameplay footage and video behind Ooe during the interview is from an early build of the game and does not represent the finished game's quality.

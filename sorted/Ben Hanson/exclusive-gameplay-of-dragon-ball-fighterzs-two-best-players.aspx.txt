  Exclusive Gameplay Of Dragon Ball FighterZ's Two Best Players






Here at Game Informer, we're very excited to roll out a month of exclusive features highlighting Dragon Ball FighterZ to go along with our new cover story on the game. To kick things off, we wanted to show some pure, high-level gameplay from two game designers within the game's development studio, Arc System Works. We were told the two fighters in the videos below are the best in the studio, and therefore the best in the entire world at this point.Â 
Watch the video below to see a fantastic match that shows off Piccolo and Android 16 in some exciting ways.

And, below, watch some high-level play between the two Super Saiyan God Super Saiyans... it's a silly name, we know.

  Take A 30-Minute Behind-The-Scenes Tour Of No Man's Sky






No Man's Sky is one of the most ambitious games ever made and we're excited to feature it as our cover story for the January issue. The small team out of Guildford, England is using procedural generation to create an entire galaxy worth of planets, asteroids, and space stations to explore. While visiting the studio, we sat down with the founder of Hello Games Sean Murray to learn about the tools, math, and science behind the game. We should stress that this video is captured from an older version of No Man's Sky and Murray is often using a debug camera and has access to tools that players will never see. Also, if you enjoy this long-form discussion with Sean Murray, feel free to watch his conversation with the CEO of Insomniac Games Ted Price from E3.
Watch the video below to see more from the game and learn about the technology that has allowed Hello Games to create an entire galaxy (or watch it on YouTube). To learn more about the gameplay itself, check out the latest issue of Game Informer.

  Designing The Gameplay Of Mad Max






For our April cover story, we journeyed over to Avalanche Studios in Sweden to finally fully pull the veil off of the open-world Mad Max game. We have a full month of exclusive content that we'll be rolling out in our hub, but to start things off we wanted to give you a high-level idea of what this game is and how it plays. Mad Max's game director Frank Rooke was a creative director at Monolith on games like Condemned before transitioning to WB and then to Avalanche three years ago when "they needed a little help getting the reset started" on this project. We spoke with Rooke and senior producer John Fuller about the "backbone" of this game, the core gameplay loop, and why the team is so proud of their approach to physics-based car combat.

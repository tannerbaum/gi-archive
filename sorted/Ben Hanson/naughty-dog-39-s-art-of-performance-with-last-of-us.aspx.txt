  Capturing Joel And Ellie For The Last Of Us






Naughty Dog's Uncharted trilogy received plenty of praise for the natural performances from the actors and the all-encompassing method of capturing that performance. The same techniques are being applied to Naughty Dog's new IP, The Last of Us. By capturing both the motions and vocal performance of the actors, the characters in the game feel more unified and real. Watch the video below to learn more about the actors behind Joel and Ellie and to see their raw performances.

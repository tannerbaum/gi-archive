  Dissecting Resident Evil HD Remaster






In our most recent Super Replay, Game Informer's Tim Turi spent hours and hours comparing the original Resident Evil from 1996 to the magnificent remake for the GameCube in 2002. While visiting Japan for our cover story on Resident Evil Revelations 2, Tim sat down with the producer of the upcoming HD version of that GameCube remake Yoshiaki Hirabayashi to compare this 2015 version to the 2002 original. Since this is not your average HD port of a 3D game, the team at Capcom has had their hands full trying to remaster the remaster in the best way possible. What are they changing along the way? Check out the video interview with Hirabayashi to learn more.
Watch the video below to see plenty of gameplay from the HD version of the remaster and learn how the team is updating a revered classic.

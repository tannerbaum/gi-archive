  Activision CEO Discusses The Pivotal Role Of Sledgehammer Games






This year marks a big change for the Call of Duty series. The inclusion of the new primary developer Sledgehammer Games into the classic Treyarch and Infinity Ward rotation allows the games to be built in three years instead of just two. So what does this mean for fans? While visiting Sledgehammer Games for our June cover story on Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, we spoke with Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg all about the new development cycle.
Watch the video interview below to learn about the reasons behind building up Sledgehammer Games, how the new development rotation will impact the games, and the overall health of the Call of Duty brand.

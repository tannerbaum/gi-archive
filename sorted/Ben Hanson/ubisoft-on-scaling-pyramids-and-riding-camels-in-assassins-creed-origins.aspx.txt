  Ubisoft On Scaling Pyramids And Riding Camels In Assassin's Creed Origins






With our new cover story on Assassin's Creed Origins, we're taking a thorough look at everything that Ubisoft is aiming to renovate with its newest entry. While visiting the studio in Montreal, we spoke with game director Ashraf Ismail about the traversal gameplay and what tweaks the team made to it, especially considering the ancient Eygpt setting. There are obvious changes, like now you can ride camels and chariots, but the team is going further than that by letting you climb "almost any rock surface" and even the Great Pyramids.
Watch our interview with Ismail below to learn more about swimming, running, climbing, and jumping in Assassin's Creed Origins.

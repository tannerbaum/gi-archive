  The Unsettling Music Of XCOM: Enemy Unknown






Roland Rizzo has been working with the XCOM series since the beginning. 
Originally in the QA department for the first X-COM title, Roland 
immediately fell in love with the spooky atmosphere of the game. A large
 part of that classic tone was created by the first game's composer, 
John Broomhall. Some tracks have aged better than others,
 but the Micropose team's work is legendary. Now Roland Rizzo is the 
audio lead for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and is tasked with reimagining and 
updating the aural tone of the original. Taking cues from the 
first X-COM's soundtrack and alien sound design, the audio team at 
Firaxis Games is creating something current yet true to the original. 
Check out the video below to hear examples of the aural atmosphere being
 created for XCOM: Enemy Unknown.

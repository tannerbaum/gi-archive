  Comparing Uncharted 4's Story And Gameplay To The Last Of Us






Following last year's staff shake-up, Naughty Dog announced that the duo behind The Last of Us would be leading development on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. While visiting Naughty Dog for our February cover story on the game, we spoke to game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann about the process of leaving The Last of Us behind and returning to the adventures of Nathan Drake. We discuss the overwhelming response to The Last of Us, dealing with the shift in tone between The Last of Us and Uncharted, and how the gameplay and development compares between the games.

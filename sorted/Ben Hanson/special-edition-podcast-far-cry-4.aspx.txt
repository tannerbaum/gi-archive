  Special Edition Podcast â€“ Far Cry 4






We've reached the end of our month of exclusive content covering Far Cry 4. We hope you've learned a lot along the way, and thanks for submitting so many questions for this podcast. We spoke to Far Cry 4's creative director Alex Hutchinson while visiting Ubisoft Montreal about his experience with Assassin's Creed III and his vision for Far Cry 4. To follow that up, we called him up just to ask him all of our community's very specific questions on the game. I (Ben Hanson) am hosting this episode along with Ben Reeves, and we get some more information on Far Cry 4's environmental hazards, multiplayer modes, map editor, and so much more.

  Understanding The Story And Gameplay Of Assassin's Creed Rogue






Last year's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was an odd entry in the series. Some players praised the game for its emphasis on freedom and exploration, while others longed for the more narrative-focused, city-based gameplay of previous entries. This year, Ubisoft is hoping to appease both ends of the spectrum by releasing Assassin's Creed Rogue for the PS3 and Xbox 360 and Assassin's Creed Unity for the new generation. Assassin's Creed Rogue, developed primarily by Ubisoft Sofia (the team behind Assassin's Creed III: Liberation), is built on the tech that brought us Black Flag and has players sailing around the river valley off the coast of North America and exploring the icy North Atlantic. We spoke to the game's narrative designer, Richard Farrese, and the brand content manager for the entire series, Jean Guesdon, about what it means to play as an Assassin turned Templar.

  Cliff Bleszinski Leads Us On A Tour Of Epic Games






The headquarters for Epic Games in North Carolina is massive. The last time our cameras visited the studio (for the Gears of War 3 cover story) it was in the middle of construction, adding a whole new wing to an already gigantic studio. We asked design director Cliff Bleszinski to lead us on a guided tour of the updated studio. Watch the video below to see the building where some of the most influential games in the industry are born... as well as giant statues, fans of Paul Ryckert, and indoor slides.Â

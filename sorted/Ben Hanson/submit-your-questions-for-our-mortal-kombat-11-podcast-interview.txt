  Submit Your Questions For Our Mortal Kombat 11 Podcast Interview






            All month long we've been rolling out features highlighting Mortal Kombat 11 from NetherRealm Studios. Hopefully we've answered a lot of your questions about the game, but now's your chance to fill in any gaps. On an upcoming episode of The Game Informer Show podcast, we're speaking with Mortal Kombat 11 designer Derek Kirtzic and will be asking him as many questions as we can, pulled from the comments below. So please leave a question in the comments section, please dive in and ask specific things about designing Mortal Kombat 11... I doubt he'll be revealing any new characters at this point.

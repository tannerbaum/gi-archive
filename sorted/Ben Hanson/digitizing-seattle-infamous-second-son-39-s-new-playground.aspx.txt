  Digitizing Seattle: Infamous Second Son's New Playground






Leaving behind the fictional cities of New Marais and Empire City, Infamous Second Son will task players with liberating the streets of Seattle as the new protagonist Delsin Rowe. While Sucker Punch wanted to make it clear that this was not a 1:1 recreation of the real-world city, the game's version of Seattle will include many of the town's famous landmarks and try to replicate the feel of America's Northwestern gem. One of the benefits of choosing Seattle is that it is the hometown of the developers themselves, which is relatively rare in the realm of open-world games.
Many of the images used in the video below are from Sucker Punch's own reference photos, so you can expect to climb and explore many of the locations shown when Infamous Second Son is released.

  Special Edition Podcast: Just Cause 3






We're nearing the end of our month of coverage for our December cover story Just Cause 3. We've covered everything from the process of designing sandbox gameplay to our hands-on impressions, but we wanted to give our community a chance to ask the game's director their burning questions. In this special edition podcast we're joined by game director Roland Lesterlin from Avalanche Studios New York and we pry a mountain of information out of him for the Just Cause fans out there.

Listen to the episode below to learn more about the gameplay, world, and the team's approach to fan mods.

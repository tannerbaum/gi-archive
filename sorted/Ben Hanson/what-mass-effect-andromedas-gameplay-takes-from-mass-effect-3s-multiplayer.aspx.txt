You can learn our impressions of what we saw by clicking here, or you can watch this interview with Mass Effect Andromeda's producer Fabrice Condominas to learn more about the philosophy for changing up the gameplay with this new entry. As Condominas points out, it's been a while since the last Mass Effect game was released and the series' gameplay needs to adapt to trends in the game industry. In addition to taking influences and cues from the wider industry, the team at BioWare learned a lot about creating fun gameplay encounters from their continued support of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer.

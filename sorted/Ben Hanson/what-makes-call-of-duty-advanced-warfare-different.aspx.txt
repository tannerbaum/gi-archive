  What Makes Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare Different






Throughout the month we're going to be rolling out features highlighting our June cover story Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Since this year's entry in the series marks the debut of new primary developer Sledgehammer Games, we wanted to start out by having the developers explain their vision for the game. We sat down with studio heads Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey to talk about what separates them from Treyarch and Infinity Ward's Call of Duty games.
Watch the video below to learn more about their high hopes for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's story, the sole protagonist Private Mitchell, and their changes to Call of Duty's core gameplay.

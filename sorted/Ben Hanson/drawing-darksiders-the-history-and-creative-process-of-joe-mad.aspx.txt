Few people are able to achieve their dream job, especially if they have two of them. Joe Madureira grew up with a love for both comic books and games and managed to make a name for himself in both fields, crafting the "Joe Mad style" within the comic book industry before venturing into the world of game design. As the creative director for both Darksiders titles, Joe's vision has led the art team at Vigil Games to create one of the most visually striking series in gaming.

  The New, Changing Gameplay Of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens






With Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens gracing the March cover of Game Informer, we visited developer TT Fusion in England to learn more about the film's exciting adaptation. The developers are aware that the wider gaming world might see the Lego games as following a faithful formula since the first Lego Star Wars, but the team is adding several new wrinkles to the gameplay this time around.

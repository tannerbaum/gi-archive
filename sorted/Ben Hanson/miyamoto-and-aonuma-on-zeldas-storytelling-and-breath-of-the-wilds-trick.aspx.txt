  Zelda's Storytelling And Breath Of The Wild's "Trick"






With the month of exclusive content surrounding Game Informer's March cover story on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we've already shown new gameplay and shared our full impressions of playing the game on the Nintendo Switch. Throughout the rest of the month, we'll be posting (more serious) interviews with The Legend of Zelda's creator Shigeru Miyamoto and series producer Eiji Aonuma to learn more about their process of steering the Zelda franchise and creating the latest game.
Breath of the Wild offers a new level of freedom and exploration to the Zelda series which left us wondering about the role of a guided narrative. We spoke to Miyamoto and Aonuma about how some of their previous comments surrounding storytelling in games have been "misconstrued" and some of the lessons learned from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
Watch the full interview below to learn more about the team's approach to storytelling in Breath of the Wild.

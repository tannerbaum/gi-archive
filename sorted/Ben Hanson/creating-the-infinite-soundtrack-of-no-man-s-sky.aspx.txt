  Creating No Man's Sky's Infinite Soundtrack






Odds are that you fell in love with the E3 2014 trailer of No Man's Sky, and the track from the band 65daysofstatic had a lot to do with that. Not only did Hello Games license their song "Debutante" for that trailer, but the partnership between the studio and the band has blossomed into 65daysofstatic composing the entire game's soundtrack and creating a No Man's Sky album. While visiting the Hello Games studio for our January cover story on No Man's Sky, we were able to sit down and discuss the past and future of the collaboration with members of the development team and half of the band. Not only is the galaxy within the game procedurally-generated, but 65daysofstatic and Hello Games are working to create a procedurally-generated soundscape so that every planet will be coupled with a unique musical experience. It's an ambitious plan (but you should be used to that by now if you're following No Man's Sky) so watch the video to learn how they are tackling the project. We should note that the video contains footage from the band's No Man's Sky concert at PSX 2014 (which you can learn more about here) and a majority of the music is not content from the upcoming soundtrack album.
Watch the video below to learn how Hello Games founder Sean Murray, No Man's Sky audio director Paul Weir, and Paul Wolinski and Joe Shrewbury of 65daysofstatic are rewriting the rules of game soundtracks.

  GI Show – Mass Effect Impressions, Blizzcon, NES Classic






Welcome back to The Game Informer Show podcast! It's a shorter show this week, since Ben Hanson is still recovering from Extra Life 2016's draining endurance run. It might be shorter than normal, but this week's episode features Joe Juba and Ben Hanson sharing exclusive impressions of visiting BioWare Montreal to see and play a ton of Mass Effect Andromeda. After that fun chat, we talk about what it was like on the ground floor of Blizzcon 2016 with Dan Tack and what makes Overwatch's new Sombra character so unique. Then we talk to Suriel Vazquez about his glowing review of Owlboy and Joe Juba about the pros and cons of the NES Classic Edition. We hope you enjoy the show, be sure to tell a friend if you think they'd enjoy this exclusive Mass Effect conversation!

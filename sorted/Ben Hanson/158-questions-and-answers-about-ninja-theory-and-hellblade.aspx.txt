  158 Questions And Answers About Ninja Theory And Hellblade






With our new cover story on Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, we're highlighting the work from developer Ninja Theory. Obviously, we're fans of their previous games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved, and DmC, so we have a lot of questions. While visiting the studio in Cambridge, England, Ben Reeves sat down with Hellblade's creative director Tameem Antoniades to ask as many (absurd) questions as we could about all things Ninja Theory. Stay tuned throughout the month for much more information and gameplay footage from Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice.

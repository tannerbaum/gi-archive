  Why Mass Effect 3 Is Our Game Of The Year






Mass Effect 3 was at the forefront of our minds as we here in the Game Informer office debated the greatest games of the year. Putting the bookend on one of the most influential series of this generation, BioWare's third chapter was a massive achievement that earned our highest praise. With one of the most controversial endings of all time (which we talked about in an episode of Spoiled!), the game gave the gaming industry a lot to discuss. 
We crowned Mass Effect 3 as Game Informer's Game of the Year for 2012. Watch the video discussion between Joe Juba, Bryan Vore, Kim Wallace, and Jeff Marchiafava to find out why.

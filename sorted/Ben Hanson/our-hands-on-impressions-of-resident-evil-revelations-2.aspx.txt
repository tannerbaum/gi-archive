  Our Hands-On Impressions Of Resident Evil Revelations 2






While we've already featured an interview with the producer of Resident Evil Revelations 2 Michiteru Okabe that shared what he saw as the highlights of the game, but we wanted to offer Game Informer's thoughts after playing the first section. Tim Turi was able to play through a large portion of the game's first episode for the cover story and Kimberley Wallace played the demo at this year'sÂ Tokyo Game Show. So how does the game feel to play? How scary is it? Should you be worried about the game's new episodic structure? Watch the video to hear our thoughts!
Check out the video below to see new gameplay footage from the game and hear Tim and Kim's initial impressions of the experience.

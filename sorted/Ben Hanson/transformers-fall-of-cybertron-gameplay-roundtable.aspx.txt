  Transformers: Fall of Cybertron Gameplay Roundtable






We've been highlighting key areas of the new game during our month of coverage on Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, but in this video discussion we hope to address some of your remaining questions. Game Informer editors Matt Miller and Ben Reeves sat down in the conference room at High Moon Studios with game director Matt Tieger and lead programmer Andrew Zaferakis for a casual conversation about the most interesting gameplay additions to Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. If you have any remaining questions, feel free to submit them for the upcoming Transformers podcast with Matt Tieger. We hope you enjoy the video, and we apologize on behalf of Ben Reeves for the bad jokes.

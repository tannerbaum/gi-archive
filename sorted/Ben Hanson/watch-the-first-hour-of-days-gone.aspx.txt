  Watch The First Hour Of Days Gone






With our new cover story on Days Gone, we're diving into details on the upcoming open-world PlayStation 4 exclusive. With this update, we wanted to let viewers get an extensive look at the game for themselves. Thanks to Sony Bend's generosity, we're able to show the absolute beginning of the game. To help guide us through the experience, I'm joined by the game's creative director John Garvin and game director Jeff Ross to talk about the process of bringing the game to life.
Watch the video below to get a look at the first hour of Days Gone, and please keep in mind that this gameplay is far from finished and the game isn't launching until early 2019.

  The Business Decisions Behind Rise Of The Tomb Raider






After four years in the making, the 2013 reboot of Tomb Raider was released and impressed both critics and fans of the classic franchise.

We also speak about the ramp up to creating the sequel and the history of Microsoft's involvement with the project.

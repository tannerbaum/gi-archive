  The Secret Of The Tailriders In Monster Hunter: World






With our cover story on Monster Hunter: World, we walked readers through three of the biggest and most exciting hunts that we played during our extensive hands-on time with the game. Sometimes to take down a huge monster in Monster Hunter: World, you need a little help. We've talked about the role of your little cat buddy Palico in the game, but you can also enlist the help of wild cats named grimalkynes to help you along your journey. Today's video shows off the grimalkynes in the game and explains the role of these "Tailriders" in helping you take down some monsters.
Watch the video below to see gameplay footage of the Tailriders in action while Jeff Cork and I explain what's happening.

  Iron Giants: Titanfall's Reinvention Of Mech Combat






During our visit to Respawn Entertainment's studio, lead artist Joel Emslie confessed his addiction to watching old making-of videos for classic science fiction films. He was studying the techniques of brilliant model-makers like Stan Winston and Ray Harryhausen to help create believable mechanical designs for the team's debut game Titanfall. Rather than relying on the formulaic video game process of concept art being recreated as a 3D computer model, Emslie made dozens of trips to the local hobby shop to find pieces in order to construct a balanced and more realistic giant mechanical suit.
Watch the video below to learn more about the process of bringing the Titans to life, how the team is hoping to change the public perception of mechs in video games, and why expressive NPC robots called "Marvins" might be your favorite characters in Titanfall.

  Hello Games Is Interested In No Man's Sky On Switch






On August 14th Hello Games is launching No Man's Sky Beyond, a large free update that will add full VR support, online multiplayer for 16-32 players (platform dependent), and a batch of other frequently requested features like animal riding. The small team is continuing to work on and optimize No Man's Sky technology (you can read more about that in our GDC interview) and, in a recent interview with Sean Murray, we asked whether we'd ever see the expansive sci-fi game ported to the Nintendo Switch.

"It's super interesting," says Murray. "I love the Switch. We're obviously very focused on what we're doing right now, but we have done a lot of work for PSVR to optimize the game. So I'd be interested to see what's possible. But at the moment, we're just very focused on what we're doing right now."

No Man's Sky Beyond releases on August 14th as a free update to the existing game, with a new PlayStation 4 retail disc launching in September as well.

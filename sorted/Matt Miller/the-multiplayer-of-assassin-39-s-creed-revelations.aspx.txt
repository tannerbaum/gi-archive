  The Multiplayer Of Assassin's Creed Revelations






We start our coverage of Revelations with a bang. Our video 
interview reveals how multiplayer is evolving in the new game.Â  
Andreane Meunier is the Live Team Producer on Assassin's Creed Revelations, which is a fancy way of saying that she helps coordinate all the online features and interactivity that will help Revelations shine. During our recent visit to Ubisoft Montreal, she was kind enough to sit down and share some details about exactly what is changing about the multiplayer experience in Assassin's Creed Revelations. 
Like Brotherhood, Revelations' multiplayer mode is a central element of the experience. The cat-and-mouse gameplay concepts that were so popular in Brotherhood will return, but they'll be accompanied by a number of changes that increase flexibility and affect how players interact with the game. There's also an extensive degree of customization and storytelling that has now worked its way into the multiplayer modes.

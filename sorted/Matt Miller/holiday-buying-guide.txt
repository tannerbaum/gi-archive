Masters of the Universe Revelation BattleCat

The Masters of the Universe are back in a big way, including an eye-catching new line of articulated action figures modeled after the character designs from the new Netflix show.

Bedecked in armor, the mask can be removed to show the bashful Cringer underneath. $39
Purchase

Kratos and Atreus Statues

Matching father and son statues bring life to one of the most memorable relationships in recent gaming history.

But it’s also the ideal display diorama backdrop for your minis collection, and beyond the 130+ included pieces, can be accentuated with an array of sold-separately accessories, including additional beds, bottles, bars, tables, and more. The titular portal is especially cool, with color-changing LEDs and an infinity mirror effect to replicate the descent into Undermountain. $349

Mickey and the Beanstalk

If your family loves cooperative board games, but some players are still a bit young for the complex stuff, this Disney adventure is a perfect compromise. Suitable for players as young as four, each player controls a Disney hero as they climb the beanstalk and retrieve food to take back down to the village below, all while avoiding the giant. Beautiful components and a three-dimensional board setup, including a twisty beanstalk that the figures can slide down, give the whole game a premium feel – a rarity in the family gaming sphere. $19.99
Purchase

D&D Dice Tower

Welcome a dose of nostalgia into your next D&D game night with this officially licensed and light-up dice tower; just remove the head and toss in your dice, and when they roll out from the base, you can find out if you rolled that natural 20. The sculpt is a lovely homage to the 1st edition AD&D Player’s Handbook art by D.A. Trampier, though it looks as if the party finally absconded with that right-eye gem. $49.99
Purchase

Alien: Fate of the Nostromo

Go back to the earliest days of the xenomorph threat with this fast-paced and fast-playing cooperative retelling of the original Alien film.

Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile

Follow the shifting power tides of a vast fantasy empire in a sprawling generational saga. Each player is an individual working to their own ends, from guiding the nation as its chancellor, an allied citizen hoping to gain influence, or a rebel working toward open revolution. Whether you muster armies in the open, or quietly gain influence in the shadows, someone eventually comes out on top. In a fascinating twist, subsequent sessions use the events of the last to inform setup, as if you’re charting the grand history of the land as it comes to pass. $120
Purchase

Descent: Legends of the Dark

The Descent franchise has a long history of providing some of the best dungeon-crawling around, but Legends of the Dark is a totally new twist on the experience. The immense box includes nearly 50 miniatures and a ton of 3D terrain for multi-level exploration. But it’s the integrated digital companion app that sets the game apart, enriching storytelling, aiding in setup, and facilitating combat. While still very much a board game for the table, video gamers will appreciate the hybrid experience and deep immersion. $179

HyperSonic DX Wireless HD In-Ear Headphones

There are plenty of very pricey options for in-ear Bluetooth headphones; it can be tricky to find a good balance between quality and cost. LinearFlux has hit on a solid offering that ably walks the line. The wireless charging case fits in your pocket, and the earbuds themselves lodge securely in place while in use. Sound quality is very good for on-the-go usage, with very respectable bass and clear tone, and the microphone does a solid job when those phone calls come in to interrupt your playlist. $79.99
Purchase

Samsung Frame TV

The Frame TV takes the obvious space-saving benefits of a wall-hung flat-panel, and adds customizable bevels and an especially thin profile. The result looks like a piece of art on your wall. That effect is further enhanced because the TV can be set to display actual museum-quality art when turned off, with an ambient light sensor to have it match the room’s current atmosphere. A subscription gets you thousands of art options, but gamers should appreciate the partnership with Xbox, which includes 20+ free art pieces from franchises like Halo and Ori. Of course, turn the TV on, and Samsung’s excellent 4K QLED display will have those (and other) games looking stellar. $599 (32-inch) - $2,699 (75-inch)
Purchase

AccuVoice AV357 Wood TV Speaker

This home audio solution ticks a lot of boxes for an affordable soundbar, but especially impressed us for its focus on gamers with partial hearing impairment. While the three built-in speakers produce a solid and clear soundscape for anyone, including a virtual surround effect, the optional AccuVoice feature boosts the frequencies of voices, even over significant background noise, effects, or music. If you frequently find yourself missing dialogue in games and movies, it’s a game-changer. $349

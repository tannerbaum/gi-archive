  Blair Witch Creeps Players Out On Xbox One And PC






Today's E3 Xbox Briefing afforded a look at Blair Witch, a new horror-themed project coming to Xbox One and PC, which will also be available at launch on Xbox Games Pass.

The game seems to focus on investigations in a mysterious wilderness in September of 1996, aided by your dog named Bullet. You play a former police officer trying to investigate the case of a missing boy. Based on the gameplay on display, things seem to play out mostly in first-person, and the use of a video camera figures prominently in the experience.

The initial trailer certainly has no shortage of haunting vibes, and left us curious to see more. The game is being created by Bloober Team (the creators of Layers of Fear) in cooperation with Lionsgate.

Check out the trailer in full below.

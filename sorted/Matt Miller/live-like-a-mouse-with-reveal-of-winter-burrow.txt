  Live Like A Mouse With Reveal of Winter Burrow






            In a press release for the newly announced Winter Burrow, the game is described as a “cozy woodland survival game,” though we have some doubts about the cozy part, given that the tail end of the trailer features the protagonist’s friend being taken away to be eatern by a hungry owl.

With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.

Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.

Give a look to the trailer to get a better understanding of how the game plays.

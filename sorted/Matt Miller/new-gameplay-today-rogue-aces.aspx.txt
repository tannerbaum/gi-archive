  New Gameplay Today – Rogue Aces






Sometimes you're in the mood for some light arcade fun, and if that desire is accompanied by a love of classic WWII-style air combat, then boy do we have the game for you. Rogue Aces comes to us courtesy of Infinite State Games. Dive into the action, and you'll be met with a procedurally generated set of missions and landscapes to fly and bomb your way through, even as you upgrade your plane, unlock new game modes, and occasionally meet a fiery end as you crash into nearby cliffs. 
Rogue Aces is out on April 12, and you can get a look at what to expect in our video below.

  Bumblebee Recalls The 80s In Full-Length Trailer






            The new Bumblebee movie is on its way to release on December 21, and Paramount today released a trailer to showcase what fans can expect from the latest installment in the long-running Transformers live-action film franchise.

The new movie is the first in the series not directed by Michael Bay, although he is still involved as a producer. Instead, Bumblebee comes to us from director Travis Knight, best known as the director of the excellent animated film, Kubo and the Two Strings.

In the trailer released today, we get a glimpse of the plucky title character bonding with new friend Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld), but we also get plenty of homages to the original generation of Transformers characters and cartoon, including the familiar transformation sound effect, shots of Cybertron at war, and even a brief snippet of Soundwave ejecting Ravage â€“ both of them looking very similar to their original incarnations.

Check out the trailer below.

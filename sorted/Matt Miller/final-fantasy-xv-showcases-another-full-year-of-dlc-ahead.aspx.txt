  Final Fantasy XV Showcases Another Full Year Of DLC Ahead






PAX East is currently entertaining showgoers, and news has emerged from a dedicated panel at that show about the upcoming plans for Final Fantasy XV. If you thought we were done with new content for the game that released in 2016, you’d be wrong. Square Enix has a bevy of new DLC drops on the way. 
Four new episodes are scheduled, including ones that focus on Ardyn, Lunafreya, Noctis, and a shorter side story episode that showcases Aranea Highwind. Across the scope of the episodes, the theme being explored is that of an alternate grand finale to the storytline.
This news comes on the heels of a successful run of DLC episodes throughout last year, including stories starring Gladio, Ignis, and Prompto, along with the multiplayer-focused Comrades release. At the recent panel, Square Enix also announced new features like raid bosses for the Comrades expansion, as well as plans for a standalone release of the multiplayer mode.

Our TakeIt’s great to see Square Enix continue to throw its weight behind Final Fantasy XV. It’s rare to see a publisher still working toward new story-based DLC so long after retail release. I'm intrigued by the idea of further developing these characters, and fleshing out an alternate take on the story's conclusion.

  Assassin’s Creed Shadows Highlights Character Differences






            The new trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows was shown off today at the Xbox Showcase, in which we got a much more comprehensive look and understanding of the gameplay we can expect later this year.

The video's opening shows off the ninja stealth action players will explore when playing as the shinobi named Naoe, with plenty of rooftop antics and nighttime assaults. The subsequent sequences showcase the samurai Yasuke, a bruiser who can hold his own in a big fight.

Check out the trailer to see the distinction between the two. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac, on November 15.

  Life is Strange: Double Exposure Revealed






            We got a first glimpse at the new Life is Strange game at today’s Xbox Showcase. Life is Strange: Double Exposure brings the return of fan-favorite character, Max Caulfield, as she seeks to solve the mystery of her friend’s untimely death.

The twist is that she experiences that death in one timeline, and her unusual powers allow her to transition into one where the murder didn’t happen, leaving her to try and figure out what happened, and somehow prevent the death in the first place in both timelines.

The new game comes to us courtesy of Square Enix and Deck Nine Games, and is targeting release on Xbox Series X/S and PC on October 29.

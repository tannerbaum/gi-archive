Hitman 2


  Agent 47 Heads To Colombia In New Video




            Warner Bros. Interactive today pulled the curtain back on one of the settings of Hitman 2 – a tease of the Colombian rain forest, where Agent 47 once again stalks and assassinate his targets with his usual flair for drama.

The location looks like something of a change of pace for the series, which often feature more urban environments.

Hitman 2 is targeting release on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and the mission is set to begin on November 13.

  Star Wars: Hunters Announced For Switch






            As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, we learned about a new competitive and free-to-play online shooter coming to Switch. Set between Star Wars Episodes VI and VII, the very brief trailer shows off holograms of various combatants, from red lightsaber wielding characters in the style of Sith, to a variety of Stormtroopers, and even a towering Wookiee.

The game is being developed by Zynga, a company most known for its social and mobile games, and which generally focuses on the free-to-play gaming space.

Unfortunately, today’s Nintendo Direct didn’t offer any additional detail about what to expect from this new competitive experience, so we’ll have to wait a while longer to get concrete details on gameplay.

Players can watch for Star Wars: Hunters to release on Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2021.

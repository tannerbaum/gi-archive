Mega Man 11


  Capcom Reveals New Robot Master, Impact Man




            Capcom has gradually been unveiling the boss fights on offer in the forthcoming release of Mega Man 11 (including Torch Man and Blast Man) , and today we get a look at Impact Man. With a stage themed around building and construction, the character recalls some of the earliest Mega Man levels from the original game. The fight against Impact Man sees the baddie deploying a variety of dangerous spike attacks. Knock him out of the fight, and you acquire the pile driver for yourself, which allows for long horizontal dashes that end with an explosive blast.

Check out the trailer below. And if seeing Impact Man brings back any memories of previous Robot Masters, share your favorite in the comments below.

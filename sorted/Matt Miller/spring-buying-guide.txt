Prism 4-Panel LED Art Panel Starter Kit

Awesome lighting can transform a space. These modular panels attach to the wall in any configuration you can imagine. They feature full RGB color customization, including multi-color and multi-zone mixes and full dimmable options, tweakable with either the included controller, via an app, or even over your smart speaker. $99
Purchase

EVO IRM-1 Toothbrush

High-end sonic toothbrushes are going to cost you a pretty penny, so why not nod to your love of Marvel’s Iron Man when you go for the upgrade? The IRM-1 features a sophisticated multi-mode cleaning engine to keep your smile looking fresh. And the way it lights up like it’s powered by an arc reactor will have you flashing those pearly whites. $199
Purchase

Wick & Skull Gaming Candles

The Wick and Skull team had the intriguing idea of crafting high-end candles to match specific gaming experiences, and they may be onto something. Or maybe it’s just nice to have your gaming space smell pleasant for a change. Shop by game, like Binding of Isaac’s oak and musk-scented “Brimstone,” or just choose a smell combo that appeals, like the lemon/ginger/saffron Health Potion. $19.99 (apiece)
Purchase

The ↑↑↓↓←→←→ BA Mug

We’re not sure if the coffee you serve in this mug is going to give you 30 lives to get through the day, but at least it’ll put a smile on your face, along with any other gamer who spies it. Ceramic construction holds up just fine to dishwasher and microwave attacks. No promises on alien assaults, though. $19.99
Purchase

Happy Gaming Glasses

Eye strain is a near-universal challenge for gamers. A solid set of blue-light filtering eyewear can make a big difference and has the added side benefit of potentially improving your sleep routine. Spy Optic offers a range of designs; consider the Crossway or Boundless if style is a factor, while the Monolith should be your go-to if full wraparound coverage is the top priority. $90-$150
Purchase

LEGO Carnotaurus Dinosaur Chase

The Jurassic World fiction has a powerful ability to unite kids and adu lts in a shared love of dinosaurs. And the series has a lot of excitement around it right now, from an animated series to the big new film. While you can find more complex sets from LEGO, this chase scene offers a rewarding mix of mini-figs, vehicles, and of course, a rampaging dino. $49.99
Purchase

Miles Morales Bust

Immaculately sculpted to present Spider-Man as he appeared in his recent video game, this 10-inch bust features textured detail across the mask, and the vibrant reds pop just like they do off the screen. The golden shock effect is the perfect accompanying wrap, adding to the already impressive silhouette. $175
Purchase

TMNT: Turtles In Time Pirate Rocksteady & Bebop

NECA’s Turtles line-up continues to impress, with fun poseable figures and an impressive array of characters. We’re partial to the pixelated touches added to the Turtles in Time line, which gleefully recalls that classic arcade game and all its bonkers stages, including this fan-favorite encounter against pirate-themed Rocksteady and his rapier, alongside his buddy Bebop, whip in hand. $59.99
Purchase

Sonic The Hedgehog Gallery Diorama

This five-pound and roughly 5-inch sculpture nails the look of the recent film version of Big Blue’s adventures, depicting the little hedgehog at 1/6 scale as he stands atop one of Robotnik’s drones. $49.99
Purchase Purchase at Gamestop

Dungeons & Dragons Cattie-brie Statue

D&D has had decades to build up a stable of memorable characters across novels, comics, and campaign adventures. But we’ve seen all too few collectibles from the brand. That’s why this slick 8.65-inch statue is so gratifying, bringing R.A. Salvatore’s Cattie-brie to life in her original bow-wielding badassery. Who needs a drow ranger when you’re wielding Taulmaril? $59.99

HeroQuest

The original 1989 dungeon-crawling classic has received a loving remake. Rather than mess with the approachable rules and fondly remembered quests, the new version mostly opts for cosmetic improvements, like a larger board, all-plastic furniture pieces (rather than cardboard), and a slew of new art and miniature sculpts. $125.99
Purchase Purchase at Gamestop

Elder Gods Resin Dice

RPG players take a great deal of pride in their dice, often imbuing personalities on individual polyhedrons, so it makes sense you’d want a high-end set. Rollacrit’s sharp-edged resin dice have some beautiful flair without breaking the bank. We’re partial to these Lovecraftian beauties, but there’s a wide array of alternatives to suit your style. $35.00
Purchase

Cooperatively steer a cast of kids as they juggle solving the region’s mysteries and dealing with the comparatively mundane tasks of chores and home life. Stellar production value and innovative freeform gameplay are sure to fascinate. $74.29

EZQuest Ultra HD HDMI Cables

Anyone who has spent enough time around electronics can tell you that you should be cautious of overpriced wiring solutions. But that doesn’t mean you should still be rocking that old HDMI 1.0 cable that came with your console 10 years ago. EZQuest’s Ultra HD cables offer a good combination of affordability and quality. Nylon braiding and solid aluminum connection housings hold up to punishment, but it’s the support for just about any high-end connection that should give you peace of mind. $19.99
Purchase

ESL iOS Mobile Gaming Controller

If you’ve found yourself embracing the growing potential of the mobile gaming scene, it won’t be long before you want something more robust than a touchscreen input option. The ESL offers a familiar shape and form factor for console gamers, a raised mount into which your phone can comfortably rest, and passthrough charging. Play experience is strong with no recognizable lag. $59.99
Purchase

iPad mini

The latest iteration of the iPad mini is uniquely suited to those looking for a combination of portability and strong gaming performance. The 8.3” display is smaller than its cousins, but loses no clarity in its liquid retina display, and the blazingly fast A15 Bionic chip matches what you’ll find in the latest iPhone 13 Pro. Tech jargon aside? This little beast looks great, plays fast, and should impress whether you’re gaming, streaming movies, or just about anything else. Starting at $499

PS5 DualSense Quick Charging Stand

The curved cradle design of Razer’s new DualSense chargers is the biggest plus here. It makes it easy to drop your expended controller in after a long night of gaming, as it slides effortlessly into place without any plug-ins.

Philips Fidelio L3 ANC Headphones

Competition is fierce in the over-ear wireless headphones scene.

A classy but understated design and impressive overall performance makes this one you should add into consideration as you juggle the many options on the market. $349
Purchase

Xbox Force Feedback Racing Wheel DLX

Designed for use with a wide variety of Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One racing games, Hori’s force feedback brings you about as close to hugging those curves as you can get without being in a real driver’s seat. Heavy pedals stay put while the dual-motor feedback-driven wheel clamps to a table or other flat surface. The pushback sensation is impressive at full power, but extensive fine-tuning options let you fully customize your ride. $299

Sandisk 128 Dual Drive Luxe USB Type-C

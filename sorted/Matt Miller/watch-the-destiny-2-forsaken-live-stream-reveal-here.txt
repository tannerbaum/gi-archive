  Watch The Destiny 2: Forsaken Live Stream Reveal Here






            Bungie is ready to talk about what’s coming in Destiny 2’s second year, and we can expect to learn the first snippets of information from a live stream scheduled for today at 12pm ET/11am CT/9am PT. As revealed yesterday, the new expansion is entitled Forsaken, and a video tease offers a glimpse of Cayde and a Guardian visiting what appears to be the Reef – a locale within the universe that hasn’t yet played a major role in Destiny 2.

You can watch the full Twitch reveal in the embedded video below once it goes live.

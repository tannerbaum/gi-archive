  Get A First Look At Surreal Adventure Game Creaks In Debut Trailer






            Amanita Design has revealed a trailer and a few details about its upcoming adventure game, Creaks. Creaks seems to follow in the trail of the studio's previous work, with a whimsical art style and puzzle-focused gameplay. But, if the trailer can be interpreted, this game explores the idea of what lies behind those creaky walls in an old house.

Amanita Design has won praise for its previous games, including Machinarium and Botanicula.

Creaks is targeting release on PC and consoles in 2019.

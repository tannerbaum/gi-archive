X-Men Destiny


  Another Hero Revealed For X-Men Destiny




A new hero has been announced for Silicon Knights' upcoming action/RPG. 
X-Men Destiny posits an alternate reality of the X-Men mythology in which Professor Xavier is dead and the dream for human/mutant harmony is rapidly falling apart. Players adopt the role of a newly discovered mutant, and develop their mutant powers as they like.
Silicon Knights has revealed another of the hero characters you'll get to choose from. His name? Grant Alexander. The recent press release had this bio info to share about the aspiring footbal superstar. "Grant is in San Francisco hoping to land a starting spot for the University of California, Berkeley, Varsity Squad. Oblivious to the world tensions, Grant doesnâ€™t see that the peace rally and threatening protesters around him have any connection to his life. When he discovers his own mutant powers, Grant is faced with the realization that mutant/human relations are absolutely his problem."
Previously, Silicon Knights revealed Aimi Yoshida as another hero in the story.

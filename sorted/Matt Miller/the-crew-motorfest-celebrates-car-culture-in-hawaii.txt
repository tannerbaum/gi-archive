  The Crew Motorfest Celebrates Car Culture In Hawaii






            Todayâ€™s Ubisoft Forward brought us a deeper look at The Crew Motorfest, with a look at the setting of Oahu, Hawaii and the racing we can expect to enjoy there.

Players will explore the city of Honolulu, drive up volcanic rocks, and along beachsides. It seems clear that The Crew Motorfest has drawn at least some inspiration from the destination-focused gameplay of other racing games like Forza Horizon.

The game is also embracing the focus on car collection, including an option to import your car collection from the prior Crew game.

The Crew Motorfest is targeting a beta in July, so players should be able to get a better sense of the racing action in just a few weeks. The game is out on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

  Anthem Trailer Brings The Action






            This year’s EA Play press conference wrapped up with a closer look at Anthem. In the trailer, we get a look at the strange universe of the game, which mixes futuristic mechanical suits with an overgrown wilderness. We also saw a glimpse of character interactions in a city environment alongside some of the action in the wilds.

The trailer also notes that the footage is from in-engine, suggesting that BioWare’s talented artists have gone to great lengths to create a beautiful world.

For more information, we just revealed Anthem is this month's cover story for the magazine. As a special treat, you can read the entirety of that story right now!

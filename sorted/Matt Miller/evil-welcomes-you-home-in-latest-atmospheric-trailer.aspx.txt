Resident Evil 7: Biohazard has been slow to share its many mysteries with fans, and that trend continues in the game’s latest trailer, which managed to sneak online earlier today. Within, we hear an increasingly troubling narrator describe the virtues of coming home, even as we observe that home as filtered through the Resident Evil worldview. Enjoy the creepy video below.
Resident Evil 7 is now only a few days from launch on January 24, when it will be playable PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Learn more about the game by watching some of our hands-on impressions and gameplay.

            Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  

Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  

Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.

Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.

Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

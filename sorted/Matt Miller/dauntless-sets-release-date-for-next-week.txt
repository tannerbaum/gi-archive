  Dauntless Sets Release Date For Next Week






            Phoenix Labs today revealed a release date for Dauntless, its monster-hunting cooperative action game. Players can dig in and try the full game on May 21 on their preference of PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or on PC through the Epic Games Store.

While this signifies the game moving from beta to full release, the team has already been releasing regular content updates for some time, so this release will accompany Hunt Pass Season 5, which is called Hidden Blades.

One of the biggest things players can expect to find is a rework of the existing campaign, which aims to improve crafting, questing, as well as better details at the end of a hunt to indicate how you’ve progressed.

Whether you’re a seasoned Dauntless hunter, or you’re ready to kill some behemoths for the first time, you can learn more about Dauntless’ launch at the game’s official blog. You can also check out our initial review from last year.

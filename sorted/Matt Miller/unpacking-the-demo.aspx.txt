Our video interview with Bungie president Harold Ryan offers
additional insight into classes, weapons, upgrades, and Cortana's
replacement. 
One of the most exciting demos of E3's press conferences was
the first public unveiling of gameplay for Bungie's Destiny. On the following
morning at the E3 show floor, we sat down with Harold Ryan to go into additional detail on all
the new content that was seen in the extended live gameplay sequence. He
spoke to us about several of the features that we saw for the first time in
this new demo. We got more details on the game's upgrade system and weapons, and
he explained the three classes on display in the game, implying that more were
on the way in future announcements. He also offered some detail on the "ghosts,"
new companion characters that fulfill a similar role to Cortana in Bungie's
previous Halo games. 
Check out our full video interview directly below, and scroll further down for a bevy of new screenshots for Destiny.Â

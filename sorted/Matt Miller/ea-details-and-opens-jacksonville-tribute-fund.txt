  EA Details And Opens Jacksonville Tribute Fund






            In the wake of the shooting at a Madden tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, which left two dead and almost a dozen others injured, EA announced earlier this week plans to open a tribute fund for the victims. The publisher today offered details about the fund, and opened it up to contributions from the public.

As detailed in a post on EAâ€™s site, and in cooperation with the GoFundMe and the National Compassion Fund, individuals can visit this site to contribute. 100% of the collected funds go directly to the victims and families of the shooting.

In addition to the fund, EA also has plans to hold a tribute livestream on September 6, with details on that event still forthcoming.

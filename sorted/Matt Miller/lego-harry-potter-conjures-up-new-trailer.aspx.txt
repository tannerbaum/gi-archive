LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7


  LEGO Harry Potter Conjures Up New Trailer




Years 5-7 are on the way, and a new video shows off what young witches and wizards have to look forward to in the thrilling conclusion. The Boy Who Lived is back to fight He Who Must Not Be Named. What, you think we're going to call out the Dark Lord by risking writing his name down on a website? The new trailer shows off the latest effort from TT Games and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive. LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 isn't the catchiest name we've ever heard, but it does encompass some pretty exciting events in the Wizarding World, whether you love the books, the movies, or both.

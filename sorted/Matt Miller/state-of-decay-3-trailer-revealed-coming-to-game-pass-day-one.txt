  State of Decay 3 Trailer Revealed, Coming To Game Pass Day One






            Today brought some exciting news for fans of the long-anticipated State of Decay 3, as we finally got a trailer that shows off some of the grim survival experiences waiting for players. State of Decay 3 doesnâ€™t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.

The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.

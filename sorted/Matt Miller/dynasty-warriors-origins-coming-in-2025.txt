  Dynasty Warriors: Origins Coming In 2025






            It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.

The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.

That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.

A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.

We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.

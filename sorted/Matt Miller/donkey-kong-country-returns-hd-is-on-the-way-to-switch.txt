  Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Is On The Way To Switch






            Todayâ€™s Nintendo Direct brought news of the welcome return of Donkey Kong to Switch. Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is headed for release on January 16, 2025.

The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.

The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

Check our the new trailer for yourself below.

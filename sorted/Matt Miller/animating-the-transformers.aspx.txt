  Animating The Transformers






Get a fascinating glimpse into the biggest challenge facing the Fall of Cybertron animation team: transforming robots. Watch Optimus Prime, Grimlock, and Jazz change form in the videos ahead.  The team at High Moon is laser-focused on creating an authentic vision of the Transformer characters -- one that is true to the roots of the character concepts, while still moving the fiction and visual treatment forward in exciting new directions. That philosophy is on display in a big way through the animation work that is going into Fall of Cybertron. Each character's unique transformations is built to represent the nature of the character. Optimus Prime pounds the ground with the force of a gorilla. Jazz flips and twists like a break dancer. Grimlock morphs into a destructive monster like an uncontrollable hulk bursting forth from a smaller form.The development videos below offer a close-up look into the technical and artistic challenges facing an animator, not to mention some early glimpses of these characters in action.Enjoy!Optimus PrimeVideo Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time /Duration Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time - 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedQuality LevelsAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.

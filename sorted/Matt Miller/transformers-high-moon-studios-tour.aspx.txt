  Transformers: High Moon Studios Tour






We were lucky enough to be invited by High Moon Studios to come visit their offices near San Diego, California, where we got a close look at Transformers: Fall of Cybertron in action. From an unassuming exterior, visitors enter a near-museum of Transformers goodness. Transformers toys litter the tables and work spaces, and the walls are plastered with character and environment art, both from War for Cybertron and from this newest game. Take a tour with High Moon president Peter Della Penna as he explains the history of the studio. Keep your eyes peeled, and you may see some hints of some unannounced characters on the way in Fall of Cybertron.

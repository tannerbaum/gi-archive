  Akira Toriyama’s Sand Land Game Announced






            Today’s Summer Game Fest gave us a first look at Sand Land, the new game from Bandai Namco, based on a manga by celebrated artist, Akira Toriyama.

The new game boasts a gorgeous art style that is unmistakably rooted in Toriyama’s style, and seems to mix action, vehicles, and fighting game mechanics together to tell a story set in a mysterious desert world.

It’s unknown at this point if the game will follow the same thread as the original manga. If it does, the story will follow a former general named Sheriff Rao as he tries to overcome a corrupt king with the help of the demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief. The three work together (including stealing a tank) to bring water back to a parched world.

There’s still much to learn about the video game adaptation, but the announcement trailer looked beautiful. Sand Land is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but no word yet on release date.

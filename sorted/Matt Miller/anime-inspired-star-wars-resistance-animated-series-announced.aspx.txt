  Anime-Inspired Star Wars Resistance Animated Series Announced






Created by Dave Filoni of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels, the new Star Wars Resistance is set to fly onto screens this fall, when it will premiere on the Disney Channel, and afterward on Disney XD. 
The series focuses on a pilot named Kazuda Xiono, a pilot working for the Resistance as it seeks to learn more information about the First Order. In addition to its lead character, the series also promises the appearance of BB-8, along with Poe Dameron (voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Captain Phasma (voiced by Gwendoline Christie). 
In a quote about the upcoming series, Filoni offered some insight into what we can expect. 
The idea for Star Wars Resistance came out of my interest in World War II aircraft and fighter pilots. My grandfather was a pilot and my uncle flew and restored planes, so that’s been a big influence on me. There’s a long history of high-speed racing in Star Wars, and I think we’ve captured that sense of excitement in an anime-inspired style, which is something the entire team has been wanting to do for a long time.
The announcement of Resistance comes just weeks before the cinematic release of Solo: A Star Wars Story.

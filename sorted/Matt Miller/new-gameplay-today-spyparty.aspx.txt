  New Gameplay Today – SpyParty






SpyParty has had a lengthy development history. Hecker first showed the game off way back in 2009, but the years since then have allowed the lone wolf developer to continue to hone the gameplay. The early access version that released today still isn’t feature-complete, but it does offer players a chance to explore the ins and outs of the experience.
We dropped in for some first impressions of the game, and our video shows off a bit of both the sniper and spy play. Enjoy!

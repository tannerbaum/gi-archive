Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X


  Miku Takes The Stage On PS4 And Vita




It’s fair to say that Hatsune Miku represents a different branch of the rhythm/music genre than many in North America are accustomed to seeing. Rather than the distinctly American vibe of beat-matching we see in games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero, Hatsune Miku dances and sings her way through poppy numbers wearing over-the-top outfits, representing some of the flamboyant and quirky elements that many players love to see in Japanese gaming. Today sees the release of Hatsune Miku’s newest game, and the trailer below gives you a good sense of what you can expect. 
Project Diva X features more than 30 songs, mixing both new and returning tracks for Miku to dance through. This release also includes a Concert Editor that allows players to produce your own shows, with distinct outfits and songs. 
Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X has arrived today on PlayStation 4 for $49.99, and Vita for $39.99.

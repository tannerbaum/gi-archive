  New Gameplay Today – Void Bastards






            We’ve had the chance to play through and review Void Bastards, and you can read the full review to learn our final verdict. If you’re hoping to get a glimpse of the game in action, you can also dive into our video above and get a sense for how the gameplay feels. 

Void Bastards demands that you take on the role of a series of unfortunate interstellar prisoners as they are revived and forced to work to get their derelict spaceship active again. By sneaking aboard other ships and slowly building up your capabilities and tools, you must jump through increasingly silly bureaucratic demands in the hopes of trying to stay alive just a little longer.

Joe Juba, Leo Vader, and Matt Miller sat down to show off a bit of what you can expect. Enjoy!

  Insomniac Reveals Photo Mode For Spider-Man






            Insomniac today showed off a photo mode for the soon-to-release Spider-Man game on PS4. In a video that was part of Insomniac’s tweet (viewable below), you can see the flexibility on offer in the new mode, which allows quick freeze frames, rotations, filters, and plenty more; for enterprising fans, it seems like the mode would offer more than enough options to craft your very own Spidey comic book.

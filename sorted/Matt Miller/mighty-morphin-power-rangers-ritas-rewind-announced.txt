  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind Announced






            Summer Game Fest 2024 gave us the first look at the new Power Rangers game, and it’s looking like a blast from the past.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind comes to us via studio Digital Eclipse, and the project appears to be a sidescrolling brawler beat-‘em-up at its heart, with multiple players working together to beat up baddies as they move right across the screen, echoing other favorites of the genre like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or X-Men. But the game also appears to feature other vehicle sequences, including what looks like first-person Zord punching sequences.

The game features online and offline co-op for up to five players.

If you’re looking to pull on your preferred colored ranger suit, you can watch for release on PC and consoles later in 2024.

  Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn Sets July Launch






            Today’s Xbox Showcase gave us a new look at Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, an action/role-playing game all about taking down a host of ancient gods. The game is in its final days of development from A44 Games, the same studio that released Ashen.

The trailer shows off the action in an open world that recalls titles like God of War and Elden Ring. The team has previously said that the action draws at least some inspiration from Soulslike games.

With today’s announcement, we know we won’t have long to wait until the game is available to try for ourselves, with a release date of July 18 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Check out the new release date announcement trailer below for a glimpse of the action.

  New Gameplay Today – Ape Out






            Devolver Digital has made a habit of taking on some fascinating indie projects under their publishing banner in recent years, and today’s featured game is no exception. Ape Out comes from developer Gabe Cuzzillo, and features a gorilla who is on a frantic breakout attempt from imprisonment.

The top-down action of smashing past your oppressors is accompanied by an awesome freeform jazz soundtrack that reacts to every punch and throw you make.

Leo Vader and I sat down to play through a bit of the insanity. Take a look in the video below!

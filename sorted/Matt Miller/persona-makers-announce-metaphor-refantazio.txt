  Persona Makers Announce Metaphor: ReFantazio






            The influence of the Persona games is in full evidence in the first real look at Metaphor: ReFantazio, the new new fantasy RPG on the way from Atlus. From overall visual styling to UI  and fonts, it’s clear that the team at Studio Zero is trying to borrow from that celebrated series.

But make no mistake, this is a brand new game and universe. Fans of the surreal and surprising narrative beats of the Persona series will certainly find a lot to love, even as the new setting may be enough to invite new players into the mix.

Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to release in 2024 for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

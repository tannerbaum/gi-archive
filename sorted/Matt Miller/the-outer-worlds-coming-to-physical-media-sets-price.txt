  The Outer Worlds Coming To Physical Media, Sets Price






            For our March issue cover story, we visited Obsidian Entertainment to take a deep dive into The Outer Worlds. Led by Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, two of the creators of the original Fallout, the new game has sparked the imagination of gamers with its new original sci-fi pulp setting and its first-person RPG gameplay. It’s safe to say that the game has rocketed into the territory of highly anticipated, and we now have some more details about how publisher Private Division is planning to handle release.

In addition to its availability on digital platforms, The Outer Worlds will also be available on disc at physical retail on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. [Editor's Note: Private Division followed up after our publication of this article to correct their earlier statement, clarifying that The Outer Worlds will indeed come to physical retail on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but will be digital-only on PC.] Regardless of format, Private Division has shared with us that the game will retail for $60.

While we know the platforms and price, Obsidian and Private Division are still not ready to share a release date for the game. As of now, we only know that The Outer Worlds has a planned release date sometime in 2019.

  The Elder Scrolls V Desktop Wallpapers






            We've been rolling out as much information as we can about Bethesda's new role-playing game throughout this month, and our readers seem to be as excited as we are about the potential of this great-looking title. As a little thank you for following our coverage throughout the month, we've put together a couple of desktop wallpapers. Feel free to download one or both of them (in the size of your choice) from the links below.

We also wanted to let you know that there's more to come. We have some exciting new gameplay details and glimpses into the Bethesda studio coming next week. Check back in the coming days and you'll find a dedicated article on the combat of Skyrim, including Bethesda's exciting dual-hand approach to battles. We'll have a video about the talented art team and the work they do at the studio. In addition, watch for a focused piece on Skyrim's completely overhauled user interface and menu system, and how it differs from what you remember in Oblivion. 
Need to catch up on the rest of what's going on with Skyrim? Explore our game hub by clicking on the image below.
Thanks again to all our readers, and a special thank you to the folks over at BethesdaÂ  for all their hard work on this project we're all so excited about. Enjoy the wallpapers, and have a great weekend!

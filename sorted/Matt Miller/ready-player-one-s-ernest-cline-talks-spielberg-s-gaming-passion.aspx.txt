  Ready Player One’s Ernest Cline Talks Spielberg’s Gaming Passion






Ready Player One is currently in theaters, and we had the chance to sit down with the author of its source material. Not only did Ernest Cline craft the original book, but he is also credited alongside Zak Penn as screenwriter for the film treatment. If you want to hear Game Informer's full thoughts on the film, check out our bonus podcast where we dive in deep.
In an extended interview for The Game Informer Show podcast (click here to subscribe), Game Informer’s Ben Hanson had the chance to go in depth with Cline about his inspirations, working together with Spielberg, and just how insane it is to see his work brought to live on the big screen.

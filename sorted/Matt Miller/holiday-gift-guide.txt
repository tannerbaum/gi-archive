Available on CD, cassette tape, or two-record LP, you can crank up the sounds of the Mushroom Kingdom in your format of choice or snag the iam8bit-exclusive 7-inch record focused solely on “Peaches” and “Mario Brothers Rap.” $13 to $43

Take this enjoyable fantasy skirmish game that ably manages anywhere between two and eight players. Trials of Tempus plays as a team-based cooperative experience. The two teams of adventurers venture onto the board, completing missions.

Dreams and Machines: RPG Starter Set

Set on a distant colony world hundreds of years after a devastating war against artificial intelligence, Dreams and Machines eschews the bleak grays of many post-apocalyptic settings and focuses on a hopeful but exciting world of mechs, lost technology, and humanity coming together to thrive. Modiphius leverages its 2d20 game system previously used to great success in the team’s other games. Here, it is clearly explained and gets you into the action fast. The Starter Set is smartly organized and will have you hungering for more. Few recent tabletop RPGs have offered such a smooth and approachable onramp for players of any experience level. $37

Sony INZONE Buds

For those players looking for personal audio solutions instead of a larger home theater system, the most common choice is to move to a full-sized headset. However, the bulk and size of larger cans can be uncomfortable. Sony’s latest entry into its InZone line aims to solve that problem with dedicated noise-canceling earbuds providing exceptional sound in a tiny package. Earbuds can sometimes have trouble separating distinct noise sources, like dialogue and sound effects, which is a big deal in games, but this new InZone model performs admirably. We were impressed with the battery life and the very comfortable fit. For PS5 or PC gamers, they’re an ideal choice. $200

HyperX Clutch Gladiate RGB Gaming Controller for Xbox

Only a few years ago, quality customizable game controllers were mainly in the expensive high-end market. HyperX is making a case for a more affordable option, especially if you enjoy some flashy color in the mix. The wired controller uses onboard controls to flip between seven colors and five brightness levels across three distinct effect patterns. But it also has functional flexibility thanks to dual trigger locks for short or long pulls, and remappable rear buttons. $45

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Bastila Shan Statue

Few elements of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace became such a focus of attention as the double-bladed lightsaber. Enter Bastila Shan the Jedi from Knights of the Old Republic, wielding a sweet yellow double-blade as she wades into one battle after the next. This new statue is undoubtedly the best representation we’ve seen of the character, as she slices through a Dantooine Guardian Droid while seeming almost to take flight. The 10-inch display is made of PVC and is a fantastic way to celebrate the fan-favorite 2003 game. $80

World of Warcraft: War of the Scaleborn Novel

Longtime WoW players tend to be especially fascinated by the complex fictional history of Azeroth’s dragons. The related characters and conflicts took center stage in the game’s Dragonflight expansion, while this new novelization delves deep into the related backstory. Offering insight into central figures like Alexstrasza and Iridikron, it’s a chance to go deep into the origins of core storylines from the game, with snappy, engaging prose that makes for an entertaining read. $30 (Hardcover)

PDP Nintendo Switch Sonic Realmz Wireless Controllers

PDP has been one of the best third-party controller companies of the generation, and with its new line, it makes bold aesthetic choices for superfans of Sonic the Hedgehog. The Sonic Realmz Wireless Controllers for Switch paint pictures of iconic zones in the palms of your hands. But rather than solely relying on flat images, the transparent controller casing includes an actual Sonic toy inside the handle. And with 40 hours of battery life, that’s a lot of time to get a good look at those figures. $60

Expeditions

2016’s Scythe won high praise for its nuanced and flexible approach to an engine-building strategy game set in an alternate 1920s European history. Its sequel, Expeditions, maintains the stark and beautiful visual styling and focus on building a slowly accelerating engine toward victory, but the card-focused play is a whole new experience. Players take their mechs into Siberia to discover the secrets of a mysterious meteorite crash, but the real fun is discovering the different paths to winning. $75

Blendjet 2 Portable Blender

Whether you’re mixing a protein shake during a hike or throwing together frozen margaritas at a friend’s house party, having an on-the-go blender can come in handy. The Blendjet 2 combines form and function, delivering a portable device that can mix ice, frozen fruit, and more in less than 20 seconds (and self-clean in even less time). Blendjet 2 comes in dozens of colors, but the ones themed after TMNT and Toy Story caught our eye for fans looking to express themselves. $120

Iron Man MK50 Bust

Diamond Select Toys continues its long-running series of detailed half-scale busts with this striking take on Iron Man in the Avengers: Infinity War movie. Made of resin, the metallic hues of red and gold pop on a shelf display, and like other bust statues from the line, the pedestal base is uniquely designed to match the character. Place it by your gaming station to inform your in-game story choices with the question: “What would Tony Stark do?” $200

Magnetic ROG Ally Case

We’ve previously touted the high quality of the ROG Ally as a natural competitor with the Steam Deck. If you’ve made the leap to one of these portable gaming PCs, you’d be wise to keep it protected. Waterfield has a wide selection of options tailor-made to fit the machine. We like this magnetically sealed leather case with room for the Ally, and internal pouches for accessories. Simple, understated, and capable of keeping scratches off your 120 Hz high-refresh rate display. $89

Magic: The Gathering Doctor Who Commander Deck

The Magic CCG continues to expand and grow in unusual and exciting new directions, often now tapping into other popular franchises. Case in point – the new Doctor Who-themed decks dip into the long history of the time-traveling Doctor across all his incarnations. For casual players, consider exploring a Commander deck, which supports larger multiplayer games (instead of just two-person duels) and lets you build your strategy around a single legendary card. Let the debate over the best reincarnation of the Doctor begin. $65
Purchase

Neptune 4 Plus 3D Printer

The once-exorbitant cost of a good 3D printer continues to drop, even as the available quality continues to rise. For interested newcomers, the Neptune 4 Plus is a solid value. Several features provide ease of use and quick setup. The 500mm/s printing speed means you’re not waiting forever to complete something cool. In addition, the impressive auto-leveling tech, along with a sizeable available printing volume of 320x320x385mm, means that you can experiment with a multitude of impressive designs. $350

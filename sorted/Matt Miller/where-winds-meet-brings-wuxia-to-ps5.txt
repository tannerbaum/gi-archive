  Where Winds Meet Brings Wuxia To PS5






            Today’s PlayStation State of Play brought a lengthy new trailer for Where Winds Meet, an upcoming action game from Everstone Studio. The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.

Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.

  Metaphor: ReFantazio Archetypes Detailed






            Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation saw the stage appearance of Atlus art director Katsura Hashino and artistic designer Shigenori Soejima, who came to offer some early gameplay glimpses of Metaphor: ReFantazio. The role-playing game is the new franchise and story from the same creative team responsible for the recent Persona games, including Persona 5.

The main focus of their presentation was on Archetypes, the game’s approach to classes. The characters of the game transform into various Archetypes, and within the storyline, these Archetypes represent the  manifestion of will to face one’s fears.

Archetypes include the likes of Ninja, Merchant, Warrior, Destroyer, Gunner, Assassin, or Knight. In total, there are more than 40 distinct Archetypes.

The subsequent trailer showed off how some of these Archetypes function in gameplay.

If you’re excited to see the Persona team’s talents translate over into a true fantasy backdrop, Metaphor: ReFantazio is on the way to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, and PC, on October 11.

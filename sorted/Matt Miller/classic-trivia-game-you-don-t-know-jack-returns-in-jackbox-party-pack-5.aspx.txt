  Classic Trivia Game You Don’t Know Jack Returns in Jackbox Party Pack 5






Today brought the announcement that the classic party trivia video game, You Don’t Know Jack, is coming back in the upcoming Jackbox Party Pack 5. The long-running comedy Q&A; game makes its return, along with host Cookie, but now with the fictional overlay of the entire game having been purchased by a corporate media company called Binjpipe. 
The game will feature eight-player support, new types of questions, and a promise to include “more than one Frasier joke for some reason.” Like the other Party Pack games, this new version of You Don’t Know Jack will let you play the game with your own phone. 
The Jackbox Party Pack 5 is headed to PC, consoles, and digital platforms this fall. 
Check out the full trailer to get a taste for the new flavor of the game.

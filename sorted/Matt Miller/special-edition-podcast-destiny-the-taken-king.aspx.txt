  Answering Destiny: The Taken King's Lingering Questions






A few days ago we asked you, the Game Informer and Destiny community, to post your questions about Destiny: The Taken King. We combed through the hundreds of responses, and pulled out some of the most common questions. Then, we spoke with creative director, Luke Smith, and executive producer, Mark Noseworthy, to see what new details we could learn.

In many cases, we received fascinating insights into the development process behind creating the game, including an understanding of why certain exotic weapons were selected as Year 2 candidates, what’s happening with Petra Venj and The Reef, and a better understanding of how a Guardian’s light value works. In other cases, it’s clear that Bungie wants players to experience certain answers for themselves when the game launches, but even those questions helped clarify what things are remaining under wraps.

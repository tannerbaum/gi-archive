  Persona 5 Tactica Gets Gameplay Details In Switch Showing






            Persona 5 Tactica was announced recently through the Xbox Games Showcase, but details on gameplay were limited. Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.

In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.

Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.

Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.

Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.

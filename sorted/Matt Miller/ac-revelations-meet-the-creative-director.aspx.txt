  AC Revelations: Meet The Creative Director






Alexandre Amancio shares his thoughts on storytelling, gameplay, and how Revelations will set the stage for Assassin's Creed III. Assassin's Creed Revelations is a big game. It's so big, in fact, that the game has six different Ubisoft studios working together in order to complete the game by this November. Behind those hundreds of Ubisoft employees is a guiding creative principle -- a single person whose job it is to coordinate all the game's creative output into a meaningful whole. For Revelations, that task falls to Alexandre Amancio. Amancio joined Ubisoft as art director on the gorgeous Far Cry 2, but his interests began to evolve towards design in more recent years. Upon our visit to Ubisoft Montreal, we had the opportunity to sit down with Amancio and talk with him about his most ambitious project to date -- serving as creative director on Assassin's Creed Revelations. In this first video, Amancio discusses the challenges and rewards of developing the new game. What is involved in coordinating the creative output for a game built in six different places around the world?

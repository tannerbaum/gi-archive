  Ubisoft Shares New Story Trailer For Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora






            Today’s State of Play offered our latest look at Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The new trailer doubles down on the impressive visuals we’ve already come to expect from the game, with a colorful natural palette that looks like a gorgeous place to explore.

We also got a glimpse of a player’s ability to ride and interact with a variety of Pandora’s alien creatures – clearly a highlight of the gameplay.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, and is headed for release in just a few months, on December 7 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

  Satisfactory Fulfills Your Sci-Fi Factory Building Fantasy






            The PC Gaming Show offered a first look at Satisfactory, the new game from Coffee Stain, the makers of Goat Simulator. The team’s new building game seems to have a significantly more serious vibe, with the opportunity to cooperatively work together with friends to build on strange futuristic landscapes. The game focuses on construction, automation, and exploration/exploitation of discovered materials.

The game plays in first-person, and an early trailer shows off the flexibility of the building systems. Learn more at the game’s official site, and check out the first trailer for Satisfactory below.

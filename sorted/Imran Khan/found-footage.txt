            As the impending release for Blair Witch, the new horror game from Observer developer Bloober based on the classic found footage horror movie of the name, draws closer and closer, we're getting more and more trailers for the game to tell us a bit more about the adventure. As of Gamescom today, we got the most extensive trailer so far, which you can watch above.

The story trailer puts us in the shoes of Ellis, who explores the deadly and decidedly creepy Black Hills Forest, a location known for disappearances and mythology in equal measures. The game is told in flashbacks, mysterious vignettes, and experiencing the horror firsthand.

In addition, there's also a new trailer focused on showing off the graphics of the game, with full 4K support. Check out some of the environments from Blair Witch below.

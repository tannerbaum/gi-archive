  Assassin's Creed Odyssey Season Pass Includes Remasters Of Third Game And Liberation






            Update: Ubisoft has clarified that Liberation will be sold alongside Assassin's Creed III Remastered, not separately. On the subject of changes to Assassin's Creed III, the publisher told us "based on player feedback, a large number of features have been revamped, tweaked or fixed. We’ll share more details leading up to the game’s launch."

The original story is as follows.

Ubisoft has announced their post-launch content plans for Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the upcoming new title in the Assassin's Creed series. In addition to what Ubisoft calls story arcs, the season pass also includes remasters of Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD.

Assassin's Creed III, which released two games after Assassin's Creed II, was supposed to bring the Desmond story arc to a definitive conclusion. It definitely, definitively did that. The game takes place during the American Revolutionary war and puts protagonist Connor at the center of a number of American history legends, such as the midnight ride with Paul Revere. The HD remaster will be updated to 4K with new textures and a new graphics engine. Ubisoft also says that there have been improvements to gameplay mechanics and ergonomics, but it is not quite clear what that means.

Liberation was a Vita-exclusive Assassin's Creed title that took place in New Orleans during the 18th century. The game eventually got ported to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, which is likely what this current gen remaster is based on. Liberation was the first, and until Odyssey, only 3D title in the series to have a female protagonist, Aveline de Grandpré.

Assassin's Creed III will also be available standalone when it releases in March, but Ubisoft did not specifically say whether or not Liberation will be available separate from the season pass.

In terms of Assassin's Creed Odyssey content, two packs called story arcs are included in the pass. Designed as episodic content, the two stories start and release new episodes every six weeks, with the first beginning in December. Titled Legacy of the First Blade, the DLC introduces players to the first hidden blade before any other assassin got their hands on it.

The second story arc, the Fate of Atlantis, takes players to the mythical sunken city to emphasize the more supernatural and fantastical elements that are being touched on in the main game.

Additionally, free post-launch support will come in the form of weekly quests, in-game events, and a return of the non-combative Discovery Tour mode from Assassin's Creed Origins.  Assassin's Creed Odyssey releases for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 5.

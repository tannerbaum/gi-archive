  Yoshi's Crafted World Arriving End Of March, Kirby's Epic Yarn Hitting 3DS Early March






In an odd bit of late-day press releasing, Nintendo has given dates to Yoshi's Crafted World and the equally-crafted Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn.

The Switch Yoshi game, which was revealed at E3 2017, has had scattered showings since its initial announcement. It re-emerged after a recent Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Direct as Yoshi's Crafted World with Nintendo adjusting the release date to 2019. They have now confirmed that the game will be launching on Switch on March 29. You can check out the newest trailer for the game below.

Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn is an enhanced port of the Wii game Kirby's Epic Yarn, a yarn-based co-op platformer released originally in 2010. The 3DS game was announced last year and adds Metaknight and King DeDeDe to the campaign. The title is releasing on March 8.

This makes Yoshi's Crafted World the first Nintendo-published Switch game to have a date after January, leaving February oddly open. The felt-textured Yoshi is also an alternate costume for the character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

  Monster Hunter Stories Now Out On Mobile Devices






Monster Hunter Stories, the 3DS RPG that released last year on Nintendo's older handheld, has gotten an abrupt port to mobile devices today. You can check out a trailer for the Monster Hunter spinoff below.

Monster Hunter Stories was part of an intended multimedia effort to get younger kids into the famously complex Monster Hunter series. The game was paired with an anime series that ultimately didn't take off and the game did not do terribly well, either, though we liked the 3DS game quite a bit.

The game is $19.99 on mobile devices and Capcom advertises that is the only price you have to pay for the game.

  Cooler Confirmed For Dragon Ball FighterZ DLC






            At the end of the Dragon Ball FighterZ tournament at Evo 2018 where SonicFox took home the gold, the producers for the game showed off a trailer for the latest Dragon Ball FighterZ content. In addition to footage of Base Goku and Base Vegeta, who have a new dramatic finish from their iconic fight at the end of the Saiyan Saga, the movie villain Cooler was also revealed.

You can see the trailer below.

The villain Cooler made his first appearance in Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge, then a version of him again in The Return of Cooler. He is the older brother of Frieza and is less arrogant about his power than his younger brother or father.

Cooler is one of the DLC characters that leaked from a datamine shortly after the game's release. So far, the entire list has been accurate, meaning that it is likely that the final DLC character for Dragon Ball FighterZ's first (and thus far only announced) season will be Android 17, Android 18's twin brother.

Dragon Ball FighterZ is currently available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. A Nintendo Switch version is releasing on September 28 and has a free beta next week.

  Tetris Effect Comes To PlayStation 4 On November 9






            Tetris Effect, the classic puzzle game re-exhilarated by Rez creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi, is coming to the PlayStation 4 in both VR and non-VR forms on November 9, Sony announced today.

We took a look at the game at E3 this year and were somewhat blown away by what this modern version of Tetris had to offer. Tetris Effect combines the tried-and-true formula of Tetris, stretching back thirty years, and combining it with Mizuguchi's trademark sights, sounds, and style represented in games like Rez and Lumines.

The game can be played either with PSVR or without, so there's no need to worry if you don't have the headset or don't feel like getting sucked into the Tetris world. If you have a PS4 Pro, Tetris Effect is 4K and 60 frames per second, as well.

You can get your hands on the game in just a few short months on November 9.

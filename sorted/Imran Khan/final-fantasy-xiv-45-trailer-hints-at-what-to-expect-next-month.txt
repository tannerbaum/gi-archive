  Final Fantasy XIV 4.5 Trailer Hints At What To Expect Next Month






Square Enix has released a trailer for Final Fantasy XIV's 4.5 update, a precursor to next summer's massive Stormbringers expansion. The update, which is scheduled for next month, has a number of big changes and readies players for the Blue Mage job class coming shortly after.

Take a look at the trailer for the update below.

The update is set to arrive on January 8, with the Blue Mages coming the following week. The new job class is a little more limited than a lot of players were like, emphasizing solo play as Blue Mages learn skills from enemy monsters throughout the game. When they hit level 50, the current level cap for the job class, players will have content called The Masked Carnivale to tide them over until Stormbringers.

With 4.5, players will also get their hands on a new instanced dungeon, a number of new cosmetics like emotes, mounts, minions, and hairstyles, new questlines for crafters and gatherers, a new raid dungeon, and a Golden Saucer overhaul. It should keep a lot of FFXIV's fans busy for a little while.

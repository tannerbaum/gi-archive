  Octopath Traveler Gets Rated For PC In Korea






The Korean Ratings Board, well known leaker of all number of ports by just publicly posting ratings long before the official announcements are made, has seemingly linked another port by publicly posting a rating before any official announcement is made. This time, it is Octopath Traveler, Square Enix's 2D JRPG released last year for Switch, now possibly coming to PC.

It's not surprising that Square Enix is interested in porting the successful JRPG elsewhere, as the company is also expanding the IP with a free-to-play mobile game, as well. Square Enix pretty clearly sees potential to broaden the universe into a larger series. A PC release would likely appeal to the same target demographic of nostalgia-seeking RPG players, much like it did on Switch.

The listing shows the publisher as Bandai Namco, which publishes Square Enix titles in Korea. It seems unlikely that Bandai Namco would also be the publisher for the game in other territories.

In the past, the Korean Ratings Board has leaked out PC ports for Symphony of the Night/Rondo of Blood on PlayStation 4, Sunset Overdrive on PC, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds for PS4, Fortnite For Switch, and Assassin's Creed Rogue for modern consoles, among many others. It is also possible Octopath Traveler might be coming to other platforms but hasn't been submitted for ratings yet.

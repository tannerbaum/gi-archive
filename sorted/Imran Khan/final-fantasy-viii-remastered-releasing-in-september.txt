  Final Fantasy VIII Remastered Releasing In September






At E3 this year, Square Enix finally broke their silence on the lack of a Final Fantasy VIII remaster, long thought to be the result of aÂ music licensing issue for the game's main theme or a complete loss of the game's source code, by announcing Final Fantasy VIII Remastered. While not an overhaul on the level of Final Fantasy VII Remake, it is a markedly improved facelift for one of the most divisive Final Fantasy mainline titles.

We now know that we won't have to wait long for the game to release, as it will be hitting September 3. You can check out the release date trailer below.

The remaster boasts overhauled character models and, at least going by the trailer, seems to have all its original music still intact. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered releases on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 3.

Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight


  The Skull-Themed Phantom Thief Controls The Dance Floor In A New Trailer




In a partner piece to the Persona 3 Dancing Moon Night trailer starring Yukari, another new trailer starring the blabbiest Phantom Thief, Ryuji, also came out.
In this trailer, Ryuji shows off his dance moves and a host of skins, including a dance outfit, his track outfit, and what appears to be some kind of butler costume. Ryuji is then joined by Yusuke and the two pair off for a dual dance, which Atlus is emphasizing in the new game over anything similar to Persona 4 Dancing All Night's story mode.
When Ryuji isn't busy announcing he's a Phantom Thief to anyone who might be listening, he was clearly practicing his dancing skills. Check out the trailer below.

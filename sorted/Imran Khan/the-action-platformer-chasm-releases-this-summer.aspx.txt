  The Action Platformer Chasm Releases This Summer




Chasm, the long-awaited action platformer that fans might remember playing on PlayStation 4 launch demo units, will finally release this summer on PC, PlayStation 4, and Vita.
The announcement, which was made today via a PSBlog update, recalls Chasm's 2013 Kickstarter that hoped to bring the game out within a year or two. The goal is slightly delayed, but the game is finally coming this summer. The team is putting their final touches on the game in preparation for release in a few months.
Chasm combines elements of Castlevania, Super Meat Boy, and more in an interesting blend on action platformers.
You can check out a quick teaser trailer of the game below.

Chasm will be available on Steam, PlayStation 4, and Vita, and will be crossbuy between PS4 and Vita, as well.

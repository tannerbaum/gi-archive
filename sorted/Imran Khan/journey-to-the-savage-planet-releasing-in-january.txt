  Journey To The Savage Planet Releasing In January






We last took Journey to the Savage Planet for a spin just ahead of E3 earlier this year and found that the game excelled in comedy but had a few other edges to clean up before release. It looks like the game is going to have all the time it takes to really make something special, however, as 505 Games has revealed that the Alex Hutchinson's planetary exploration game will release on January 28.

Alongside the release date, we also got a brand new Gamescom trailer for the game, letting us explore a bit of the eponymous savage planet and the game's newly-announced multiplayer co-op mode.

The trailer shows off areas like the Jellywaft Islands, Swamp Gully, Fungal Forest, and more. You will be able to explore all these places with an online co-op partner of your choice, as well.

Journey to the Savage Planet arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 28.

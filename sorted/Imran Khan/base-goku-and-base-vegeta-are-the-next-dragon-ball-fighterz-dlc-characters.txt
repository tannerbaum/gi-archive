  Base Goku And Base Vegeta Are The Next Dragon Ball FighterZ DLC Characters






            In a spread in Japanese magazine V-Jump, Bandai Namco has revealed the next two DLC characters for Dragon Ball FighterZ: Base Goku and Base Vegeta.

The two characters are the non-Super Saiyan versions of the characters, with Vegeta specifically having his tail from his first fight with Goku. Goku has the power to use Kaioken to chain combos together, as well as a Super Spirit Bomb which is the strongest move in the game while also being exceptionally slow. Kaioken gets stronger with each KO'd partner on the team, functioning similarly to X-Factor for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

Base Vegeta has his Galick Gun attack, as well as a Galaxy Breaker attack where Vegeta shoots energy out of his entire body. The new DLC characters line up with a leak from earlier this year, indicating that the remaining DLC characters will be Android 17 and Cooler.

V-Jump also announced that the Switch version of Dragon Ball FighterZ will be getting a public beta in August with local play, as well. It is not known if this beta is being held outside of Japan, but it's likely Bandai Namco will have different dates for different regions. 

Dragon Ball FighterZ is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, with a Switch version releasing on September 28.

Dragon Ball FighterZ has Super Saiyan Goku, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku, Goku Black, Base Goku, and Vegito. If you want, you could also include Bardock in that list. That means you can field two entire teams of people who are either Goku or look like Goku.

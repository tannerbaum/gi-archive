Dragon Ball FighterZ


  The God Of Destruction Shows Off His Skills




A new character trailer has dropped for Dragon Ball Fighter Z's God of Destruction of Universe 7, Beerus.
In the new trailer, Beerus, walking in alongside his attendant Whis, beats down on Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku. Beerus uses orbs and powerful ki blasts to both keep the opponent away and bounce them around like a plaything (or a ball of yarn).

Beerus was one of the few characters designed before Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama was brought in on the Battle of GodsÂ movie to design and help write, as explained in the March 2013 issue of Japanese magazine GetNavi. Toriyama misunderstood the name, originally meant to sound like the Latin word Virus, and assumed the name was a pun on the word Beer. As such, further characters related to Beerus, such as Whis, Chamba, and Vados all continued that alcohol theme.
Dragon Ball Fighter Z is scheduled for release on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. A beta for the game is running from January 14 to January 16, starting a day earlier for preorders, on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. You can download the client now to start as soon as the beta begins.

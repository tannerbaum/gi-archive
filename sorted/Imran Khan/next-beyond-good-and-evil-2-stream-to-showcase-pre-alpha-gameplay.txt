  Next Beyond Good And Evil 2 Stream To Showcase Pre-Alpha Gameplay






The Beyond Good and Evil 2 team at Ubisoft has been mostly quiet since the game's reveal at E3 2017 with occasional outbursts of information. This past year, we've seen a small snippet of the game's fighting system and a story trailer at E3, but not a whole lot beyond that. With the next Space Monkey Report, Ubisoft's name for Beyond Good and Evil 2 developer updates, we will hopefully see something more significant.

"As promised, we will be back with another Space Monkey Report Live Stream on December 10 at 6:00 p.m. CET / 12:00 p.m. EST," the game's website says. "We will be live on Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook. We're excited to reveal some pre-alpha gameplay, so make sure you tune in for this report! You won’t want to miss it!"

The term "pre-alpha" can vary from developer to developer, with some studios using it to mean development states where the mechanics aren't even nailed down yet and others using it to refer to any time before the game is playable on a consumer level with demos and pre-release alphas. It's hard to gauge by their use of the term exactly how far the Beyond Good and Evil sequel is right now, but we should be able to gleam something from it.

Beyond Good and Evil 2 currently has no publicly known target platforms or target date.

  Download Different Box Art For Your Preferred Octopath Character From Nintendo






            The current Octopath Traveler box art features all eight of the game's heroes together, representing the actual structure of the game fairly well. However, you may dislike a character or like one of the eight the best, so the cover doesn't serve all your needs. Fret not! Nintendo is offering different box arts for download on their website.

You can get them from the MyNintendo store here and the entire set cost you 50 platinum points. The Platinum points don't come from purchases, so you don't need to worry there, you will get enough points from logging in and clicking around the site for a bit.

You'll need to print them out yourself, though, and high quality prints are generally better. We're still working on our Octopath Traveler review, but you can hear our thoughts about the game on the latest GI Show!

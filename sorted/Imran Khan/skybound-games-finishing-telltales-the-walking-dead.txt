  Skybound Games Finishing Telltale's The Walking Dead






            The ongoing saga of Telltale's closure and what will become of its various projects continues to take twists and turns. Today, The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman announced at a New York Comic-Con panel that Skybound Games would be finishing the series which was only a few episodes away from finishing up.

Skybound Games is the gaming division of Skybound Entertainment, the publisher behind The Walking Dead comic, making them a logical fit for the game series. While the press release says that Skybound will be working "with members of the original Telltale team to finish the story in a way the fans deserve," there were no details of exactly what that means. It's not clear if that means the entire The Walking Dead: The Final Season team, everyone who wants to come back, or merely select members based on Skybound's needs and desires. 

Robert Kirkman said after the announcement that it was imperative to save the game, because "we can't lose Rick and Clem in the same year."

We have reached out to Skybound for clarification and for details about the revenue of the game. When Telltale Games collapsed, none of the nearly-300 employees who lost their job received severance payments from the company. Telltale initially intended to keep 25 employees to fulfill contractual obligations, but has seemingly let the skeleton crew go as well.

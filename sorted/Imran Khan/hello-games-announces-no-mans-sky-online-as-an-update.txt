  Hello Games Announces No Man's Sky Online As An Update






After a bumpy and controversial launch, No Man's Sky has steadily improved over the years, culminating with a massive expansion in the form of No Man's Sky Next last year. Now Hello Games is announcing the next step in No Man's Sky's direction with what they're calling No Man's Sky Beyond. The first part of that that is No Man's Sky Online, which is a massive push for a social online experience.

Check out a very, very short teaser for Beyond below.

In terms of No Man's Sky Online, Hello Games is eager to emphasize the ways people have been playing the game since Next.

"No Man's Sky Online includes a radical new social and multiplayer experience which empowers players everywhere in the universe to meet and play together," Hello Games wrote in a release. "Whilst this brings people together like never before, and has many recognizable online elements, we don’t consider No Man’s Sky to be an MMO - it won't require a subscription, won’t contain microtransactions, and will be free for all existing players."

Hello Games say it will offer more details about No Man's Sky Online and the other aspects of Beyond soon, but for right now, fans can look forward to more No Man's Sky in the future.

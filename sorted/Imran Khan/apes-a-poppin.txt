A very, very short trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ's next character has appeared, showing off Dragon Ball GT Kid Goku's super attacks. These attacks include his transformations, including the either maligned-or-loved Super Saiyan 4 Goku.

For his level 1 super, Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 for a short blast, but his stronger super turns him into the adult and decidedly hairier Super Saiyan 4. This form has been more or less scratched out of canon, but so has Super Saiyan Bardock and we saw that super move a billion times during Evo last year. Maybe non-canon moves will just end up being stronger for some reason.

The newest Goku to join the roster lands on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 9.

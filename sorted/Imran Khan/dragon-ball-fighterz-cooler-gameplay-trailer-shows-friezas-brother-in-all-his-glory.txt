  Dragon Ball FighterZ Cooler Gameplay Trailer Shows Frieza's Brother In All His Glory






            Bandai Namco has a tendency to offer short character trailers for Dragon Ball FighterZ, but has seemingly tried to reverse that the longer trailer at EVO and a five minute trailer right here to show off Cooler, the next DLC character for the game. Granted, that's mostly because a full fight showing Cooler off, but it's cool (er) to see him in action.

Cooler is intended to be released in late September, probably coinciding around the Dragon Ball FighterZ Switch port on September 28. The game is currently available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

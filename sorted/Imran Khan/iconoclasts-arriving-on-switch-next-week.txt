  Iconoclasts Arriving On Switch Next Week






            Iconoclasts, the newest game from Noitu Love developer Konjak, is coming to Switch incredibly soon. The Metroidvania will arrive on Nintendo's hybrid console next week on August 2.

Iconoclasts released early this year on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC, telling the story of a naive mechanic named Robin in a world that has banned people of her occupation. Through efforts to be helpful, she winds up getting involved in a major government altercation and finds herself hunted.

The Switch version is coming with a boss rush mode and another difficulty mode that lets players get through some of the game's tougher portions. Those updates will also be made available for the PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC versions, but it's not clear if those will happen on the same day as the Switch release.

We really liked Iconoclasts when it released earlier this year and even had a very spoiler-heavy conversation with the game's designer right here.

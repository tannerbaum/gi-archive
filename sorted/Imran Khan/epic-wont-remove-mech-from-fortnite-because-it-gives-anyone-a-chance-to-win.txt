  Epic Won't Remove Mech From Fortnite Because It Gives Anyone A Chance To Win






Since season 10 debuted in Fortnite with a battle between a mecha and a kaiju, mechs have become a bit of a thing in the game's battle royale mode. This hasn't been to everyone's taste, however, as whoever gets access to the B.R.U.T.E. mech tends to rack up kills in a way that seems pretty unbalanced and the player base has responded asking Epic to remove it. It turns out that overpowered dynamic is exactly what Epic had it in mind when they designed it.

Amidst a hashtag asking Epic to rescind the B.R.U.T.E, known simply as #RemoveTheMech, the developer has felt the need to explain their reasoning about it, and thus posted a new blog post.

"The mission of Fortnite is to bring players of all skill levels together to have a fun experience where anyone can win," Epic writes. "For example — everyone having a shot at that first elimination or Victory Royale moment and the satisfying feeling that comes with it. Right now, we know there are players out there who have never had that opportunity... Another part of the mission is to provide spectacle and entertainment when playing Fortnite. Bringing these moments to the game every week means there is always a new way to enjoy and experience the game."

Epic goes on to breakdown B.R.U.T.E. eliminations per game in an effort to show that the problem feels worse than it actually is. That said, they also probably don't want to make Fortnite a game that only the hardest of hardcore ever get kills, and especially not have that reputation.

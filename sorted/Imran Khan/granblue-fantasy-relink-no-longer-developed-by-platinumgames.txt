  Granblue Fantasy Relink No Longer Developed By PlatinumGames






Granblue Fantasy, a popular Japanese mobile RPG from Cygames, has been exploding into different types of games recently. Just a few months ago, Cygames and Arc System Works announced a fighting game using characters from the title. Even longer ago, Cygames announced a collaboration with action game experts PlatinumGames for a large scale PlayStation 4 RPG called Granblue Fantasy Relink. Now Cygames has announced that PlatinumGames will no longer be developing the console title and that it is being moved entirely to their internal development.

Cygames announced this change in a short and somewhat terse press release that does not go into any reasoning on the subject.

"Tokyo-based video game publisher and developer Cygames, Inc. (HQ: Shibuya-ku, Tokyo; President: Koichi Watanabe, hereinafter referred as “Cygames”) has recently been engaged in the co-development of the upcoming console game Granblue Fantasy: Relink together with esteemed developer PlatinumGames Inc.," the press release starts. "Going forward, Cygames will handle 100% of development internally."

PlatinumGames' statement indicates that Cygames chose not to renew their contract for development.

"While we, PlatinumGames, have been working with Cygames in co-development of the upcoming console game Granblue Fantasy: Relink, we officially announce our contract on the project has come to an end. Development will still continue, but be handled solely by Cygames’ internal development team."

The game was intended to be a part of Cygames multi-pronged approach to bring the wildly successful license to international fans. It is unclear why PlatinumGames is no longer involved, but this was certainly one of the biggest projects on their docket and it's likely to be fairly significant blow to the studio.

PlatinumGames is also currently developing Bayonetta 3 with Nintendo as the publisher and Babylon's Fall with Square Enix.

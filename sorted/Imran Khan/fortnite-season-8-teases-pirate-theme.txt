  Fortnite Season 8 Teases Pirate Theme






After Epic kicked up the Fortnite game by promising different non-pay ways to get the battle pass, the Fortnite developer is now moving into the game's eighth competitive season. We got our first tease of the new season today and it seems to be pirate-themed.

It seems as part of the pirate theme is hidden treasure, with X specifically marking the spot. Considering Epic's penchant for hiding hints about major events and world changes within the actual game, there may actually be a hidden treasure players have to find.

Previous season themes have included things like superheroes, a snowy fantasy Christmas, darkness rising, and more. What I'd really like to see as part of a pirate theme is ship battling, but that's probably a bridge way too far for an existing battle royale game, but imagine how much fun building a boat out of nowhere would be.

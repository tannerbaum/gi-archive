            Timespinner, a 2D indie game heavily inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, was Kickstarted in 2014 hoping to marry the structure of SOTN with the gameplay of something like Mega Man X. The original hope was to get the game released in 2017, which it missed, but it finally has a release date of September 25.

The game is about manipulating time to go back through time and dismantle the empire that killed her family. You can check out the launch trailer below.

Timespinners releases on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC on September 25. While the Kickstarter reached the 3DS stretch goal, a version for that platform has not been announced for release.

  Hunt: Showdown Is Having A Free Weekend On Steam






            Hunt: Showdown, a horror-based multiplayer shooter from Crytek, is having a free weekend on Steam. You can gather together a hunting party and take part now.

The early access shooter blends PvE and PvP to develop campaigns based around player actions. You can check out our New Gameplay Today of the game in Feburary, though it has already seen some large content updates in the months since.

The structure of the game pits players either alone or with a partner against other hunters to find and defeat the Lovecraftian beasts that terrorize the countryside. The hunt is only the beginning, though, as winning teams soon find themselves with a target on their back, thus the Showdown part of the title.

You can go ahead and get your free weekend started now, as you only have until Monday to play.

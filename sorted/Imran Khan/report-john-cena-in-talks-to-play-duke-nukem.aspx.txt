  Report: John Cena In Talks To Play Duke Nukem






A Duke Nukem movie is being made and invisible WWE superstar John Cena is in talks to play the titular role, according to a story by Hollywood Reporter.
The movie is being produced by Michael Bay's production company, Platinum Dunes. At this point, there is no director attached, or even a script. Hollywood Reporter speculates that, once Cena signs on to the vehicle designed for him, a scriptwriter will be tapped to bring the foul-mouthed hero to the silver screen.
Duke has had a rough go of it for the last decade or so, having most recently appeared as a guest character in the HD Remaster of Bulletstorm. His last full fledged game, however, was the maligned Duke Nukem Forever in 2011, a release of the development hell-burdened title was first announced in 1997.Â 
Duke Nukem first appeared in the game of the same name on in 1991 and later joined the 3D realm with the shock-filled Duke Nukem 3D in 1996.

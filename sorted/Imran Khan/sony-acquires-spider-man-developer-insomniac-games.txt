  Sony Acquires Spider-Man Developer Insomniac Games






Rather abruptly today, Sony announced that it had acquired Insomniac Games, developers behind games like Ratchet & Clank, Sunset Overdrive, and most recently Spider-Man. The announcement came over Twitter, where the PlayStation account revealed the acquisition.

Insomniac had long worked with Sony on a number of exclusive franchises, but stretched their legs with other games and publishers this generation and earlier with games like Sunset Overdrive, Song of the Deep, and Oculus exclusives like The Unspoken and the upcoming Stormlands. Its most praised games tend to be on PlayStation consoles, however, which is likely part of the reasoning behind this acquisition.

In its press release, Sony emphasizes that Insomniac will be developing games exclusively for PlayStation hardware in the future.

I wonder if this means we will be getting more Ratchet & Clank and Resistance games eventually.

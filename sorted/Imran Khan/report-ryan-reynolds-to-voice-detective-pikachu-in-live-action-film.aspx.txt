  Report: Ryan Reynolds To Voice Detective Pikachu In Live Action Film






Ryan Reynolds, the comedic actor most recently known for his role as Deadpool in the movie of the same name, is reportedly taking on the voice of the title character from Legendary's upcoming Detective Pikachu movie.
The Hollywood Reporter has an exclusive stating that Reynolds has signed on to play the part of Detective Pikachu in a movie based on the game. In the game, which never came stateside, Detective Pikachu was a detective who became a Pikachu, rather than the other way around. 
This will be the first video game movie from Reynolds, who infamously dislikes the medium. "I don’t really play video games. Is there a way to waste more [expletive] time?" Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly in 2009. "The Internet’s enough. The last videogame I played was Ms. Pacman[sic]."
The movie is being directed by Rob Letterman of Goosebumps and is scheduled to start filming in January.

Our TakeIf Jerry Orbach were alive, he would have been perfect for the role. Reynolds is a good comedic actor, though, so hopefully this isn't one of the roles he ends up regretting.

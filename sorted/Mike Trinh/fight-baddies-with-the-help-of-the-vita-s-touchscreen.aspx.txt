The Amazing Spider-Man


  Fight Baddies With The Help of The Vita's Touchscreen




Amazing Spider-Man, originally released for consoles in 2012, is coming to the PlayStation Vita’s and makes use of the system's touchscreen controls to streamline a few gameplay elements. 
Web rush, which allows Spider-Man to slow down time to quickly traverse the environment or attack an enemy, now uses the touchscreen for precise selections. Players can also navigate Spidey’s smart phone and the minimap as if they were using the touchscreen on real smart phone. One last feature takes advantage of the Vita’s gyroscope to allow players to easily aim and take pictures with Spidey’s camera. They just need to move the Vita around like a real-life camera to snap photos. 
The Amazing Spider-Man game takes place after the events of the movie and is a return to the open world. The game allows players to swing around Manhattan Island and fight re-imagined versions of Spidey’s iconic villains. The Amazing Spider-Man releases on November 19.

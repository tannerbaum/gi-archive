  Annapurna and Blue Twelve Introduce Stray, A Game About Cats And Robots






            Today, at Sony's Future Of Gaming Show, a new game was shown off for PS5 called Stray, where you play as a cat.

Annapurna Interactive is teaming up with Blue Twelve for the project. Stray transports you to a futuristic world, where robots and cats run wild. The trailer showcases an eerie landscape with the words "RIP Humans" on the wall. A robot and cat give each other a glance before we go into the cat's perspective, where we see robots engaging in everyday human activities, such as running shops. 

The game is set to come out in 2021 as a PS5 exclusive, and you can watch the trailer below.

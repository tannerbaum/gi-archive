  Exclusive Uncharted 4: A Thief's End Screens






Yesterday we revealed Uncharted 4: A Thief's End as our February cover. We also have a full month of online coverage to complement the main story, so today we're kicking things off with a first look at some exclusive screens.
The images below showcase Nathan Drake's trials, including handling his brother and making death-defying jumps.

This wouldn't be the Nathan Drake we know and love without his fearlessness. That's a heck of a leap, Nate. Also, pay attention to the detail of the environment: Naughty Dog has re-hauled its tools for this new generation, allowing for extensive detail from the wind to dew on the leaves. 

Naughty Dog likes to convey emotion through the atmosphere; notice the murkiness and darker tones. This screen, taken from the area we saw in the recent PlayStation Experience demo, features Drake down and out. He's been separated from his brother, Sam. The choppy waters foreshadow the dangers ahead. Drake must overcome the worst of luck to find Sam. Look at all the mountains in his way. At least we know climbing is one of Drake's specialties. 

A tense moment between brothers? You decide. Sam is a bit of a wild card. Just don't expect this reunion to be all fun and games. Sam and Drake have plenty to gain, but also plenty to lose. 
To see even more screens and info right now, you can pick up the digital issue. Exclusive online coverage of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End will be released every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during January. Click on the banner below to see everything so far, and keep checking back all month long.

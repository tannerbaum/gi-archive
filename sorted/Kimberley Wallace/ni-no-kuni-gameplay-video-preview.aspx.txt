  Experience Ni No Kuni's Gameplay In Our Video Preview 






In Ni No Kuni, battles are fast and frantic. Ordering around your familiars, canceling attacks, and running around to collect special glims to restore HP and MP easily keeps you on your toes. But just describing this isn't enough - we wanted you to see it in action. So as part of our celebration of our five under the radar games, video producer Ben Hanson and I sat down to discuss and showcase some of Ni No Kuni's gameplay.  Get a look at what it's like to explore the world map and see how vital it is that you pay attention to the battle at hand. Also, find out just how adorable those little familiars are - Pokémon might just have some competition yet.

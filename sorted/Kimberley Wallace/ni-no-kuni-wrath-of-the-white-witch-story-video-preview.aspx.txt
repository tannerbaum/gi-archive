  Video Preview: How Ni No Kuni's Story Begins 






Celebrating our five under the radar games worth watching, we're taking today to look at the story in Ni No Kuni: Wrath Of The White Witch. For those who don't know, Ni No Kuni is the collaboration between the famed Studio Ghibli and RPG developerÂ extraordinaire, Level-5.
In the video below, video producer Ben Hanson and I watch the opening story moments together and discuss my early experience with the game. As expected, Studio Ghibli animations tantalize your eyes along the way. Also, we meet our protagonist Oliver and see what brings him into a new fantastical land.
We should warn you, this video contains spoilers for the first couple hours of the game.

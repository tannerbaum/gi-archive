  Everything We Know About Disney Infinity 3.0’s Inside Out Play Set






Pixar's newest film, Inside Out, hits theaters on June 19
and has some powerhouse talent voicing its characters, including Amy Poehler and Lewis Black. The movie is about a young girl named Riley struggling with her
feelings about her family's move from Minnesota to San Francisco. Her emotions,
such as Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness, are personified in her mind,
living in the control center of it to try to guide her through all her
feelings. Disney Infinity 3.0 will have a play set dedicated to the characters
of Inside Out and it features its own separate storyline. Here's what you need
to know about it. 
It's a Sequel Story To The FilmInstead of just rehashing what happened with movie, the
storyline is completely new for the play set. Riley is still the star, but this
time around she's babysitting and falls asleep while watching TV. While she's
sleeping, she accidentally brushes up against the remote, changing the channel
to a scary movie. This breaches her subconscious and all these scary images get
into her head. It's up to her emotions to attend to this crisis. You'll fight
against baddies like broccoli, swamp creatures, and bats.

Get Ready To PlatformThe other play sets have been very combat focused. For Inside Out, Disney wanted something different that would have a broad
appeal. Therefore, the gameplay is centered on platforming that encourages
cooperative play.
All Characters Have Special AbilitiesAll the emotions have their own unique abilities to help you
get through the platforming challenges. This encourages players not to just
stick to one character, but to swap to others as they're playing. The best
strategy is to pick which character is best for any given situation. Anger can
run across lava, Disgust can high jump, Fear runs quickly, Joy can glide across
large gaps, and Sadness can walk across clouds.

Plenty Of Gameplay Obstacles That Encourage CooperationClouds are a big component of the levels. Sadness can walk
across them with ease, but any other character can only step on them briefly
before they disappear; you must jump quickly if you want to get past them
without using Sadness. If you're playing co-op, Sadness can pick up another
character like Anger and walk across the clouds with him, easing your co-op
partner's troubles. Similarly, Anger can pick up Sadness and carry her across
the lava should she need it. The entire set can be played single player, but
cooperative two-player gameplay is highly encouraged.
Another element is called musical gameplay. Here, you flip
switches back and forth, turning on and off various platforms. You must match
the musical lines and which platforms you're going on to get through the
various areas. This means precisely timing and syncing up with the beat to do
so.  Additionally, a gravity feature
switches your perspective, turning the world and making you platform upside
down.

Our Hands-On
ImpressionsI tested out of a short level and the platforming seemed
pretty smooth. Balloons litter the level for you to pop and collect, and I was
obsessively tracking them all down. The harder-to-reach balloons require you to
swap characters. Disgust's high jump ability comes in handy for these. Enemies,
especially dangerous bulls that charge at you the moment they see you, are all
around the level. The only way to get rid of this menace is to get near an edge
and move as it charges at you, so it falls off. This isn't as easy as it
sounds, the window is very narrow for successfully dodging them.
A lot of my level forced me to go across clouds, so Sadness
came in handy. Unfortunately, I chose to play as Anger, but that wasn't a
problem. Switching characters is simple; you just put the other one on the Infinity Base and then can bring up the character wheel to swap in a jiffy. For a
while, I was fine platforming through clouds just using Anger. It just meant I
had to keep moving and couldn't collect everything. For meticulous collectors
though, swapping to Sadness is essential, especially as the level went on and
these sequences became longer. Disney Infinity may be kid friendly, but it
still packs a challenge. I can't wait to see how involved further levels get.
The Inside Out cast is pretty hilarious in their own right, so this set seems
like a no-brainer if you find yourself loving the movie.

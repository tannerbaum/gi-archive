Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers


  See The Tactical Gameplay In Action




Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers launches next month as a digital release on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. With the release date looming, Koei Tecmo released a new trailer today showing off the gameplay. Godseekers features tactical gameplay unlike the action fare the Dynasty Warriors games are best known for; but don't worry, it still has tons of cool special moves that make you pack a punch against enemies. 
This entry follows Zhao Yun and his friend Lei Bin, who help a young girl named Lixia escape from a mystical prison. Lixia's past holds many mysteries that the two try to piece together on their journey, which leads them fighting for the salvation of the world. Godseekers puts them in historical battles, allowing them to brush shoulders with powerful warriors in Three Kingdoms era China.
The trailer below lets you see the tactical gameplay, where you move units across a grid, attacking from strategic places such as the rear or sides to get the upper hand. For tougher opponents, you have access to Lixia's orbs, which can deal deadly elemental damage.

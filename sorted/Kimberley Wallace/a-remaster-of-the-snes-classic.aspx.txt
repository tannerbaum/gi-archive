Secret Of Mana Remake


  The SNES Classic Gets Enhanced




Old-school Square Enix fans will be happy to hear that the company has announced a remade version of its SNES classic, Secret of Mana. The game is set to debut on February 15. While the Seiken Densetsu collection saw release in Japan for the Switch, this is a brand-new iteration that will see release on the PS4, PS Vita, and PC via Steam. Console fans looking to get their hands on a disc (or cartridge) will be disappointed, as this remake will only be available digitally.
However, the game will be fully voiced in English, as well as seeing a suite of enhanced 3D visuals. We don’t have the full details yet, but you can check out the game below in screenshots and video while you start your half-year wait.
If you pre-order through the PlayStation Store, you receive special character costumes: “Moogle Suit” for Randi, Primm and Popoi, “Tiger Two-Piece” for Primm and “Tiger Suit” for Randi and Popoi alongside three PSN avatars. If you pre-order or purchase the Day One Edition within a week of launch on Steam, you get three costumes and wallpaper.

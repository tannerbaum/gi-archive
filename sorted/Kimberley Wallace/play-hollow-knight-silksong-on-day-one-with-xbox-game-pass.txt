  Play Hollow Knight: Silksong On Day One With Xbox Game Pass 






            The highly anticipated Hollow Knight sequel, Silksong, appeared at the Xbox Games Showcase with a snazzy new trailer, but the biggest news is it will be playable day one on Xbox Game Pass.

Announced back in 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong takes place in a haunted kingdom swarming with bugs. As insectoid creature Hornet, your weapon of choice is a needle. The gameplay is said to be largely similar to its predecessor, but with an increased focus on speed. The latest trailer showed off more of what to expect, with an impressive showing of the striking art style, swift platforming, and unique baddies. You can watch the trailer above to see what I mean. 

No release date was revealed for the Xbox and PC versions.

Combining two popular franchises can have disastrous
results, but Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth gets so much right. It brings
two Atlus RPG series - Persona and Etrian Odyssey - together in an unexpected
way, and each benefits from the strengths of the other.  Thought Etrian Odyssey
had uninteresting characters? The Persona 3 and 4 casts add the personality
that's been missing from the punishing dungeon crawler. Did you want Persona's
battle system to be more rewarding? The harrowing dungeons and new tweaks to
combat keep you on your toes. Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth has creativity
and challenge around every corner, making it a stellar crossover.
Persona is fantastic at characterization, and Persona Q
capitalizes on that when the casts of Persona 3 and 4 meet. The journey entails
fighting through dungeons to discover why these two groups, along with two new
amnesiac characters, have ended up together. The highlight is seeing how the
casts of the two games interact, and of course, witnessing your favorite
personalities again. Yes, Kanji still tries to act like a tough guy, but it's
even more fun seeing him charmed by the adorable dog, Koromaru. Plenty of
callbacks are present throughout Persona Q, and the charisma of the two groups
keeps dungeon treks interesting. 
As with the Etrian Odyssey games, this first-person dungeon
crawler still has you mapping out areas with your stylus, a throwback to
old-school RPGs like Wizardry. This requires a patient touch, as you must look
every which way to make sure you've marked things, like doors and walls,
correctly, or else you have to retrace every step. Some people might find this
tedious, but there's something thrilling about emerging victorious after
finding your own way through a dangerous area. 
The Etrian Odyssey series has always provided a satisfying
challenge, but it's struggled with a few things, such as uninteresting
labyrinths. After themed dungeons spiced things up in Persona 4, this game
captivates with even more creative dungeons. All have fun and unique themes,
like Alice in Wonderland, Japanese horror, and romance. These themes are
incorporated in several clever ways; for instance, in the haunted labyrinth,
the FOEs (mini-bosses) are terrifying babies who lunge at you, and you see
footsteps, blood dripping, and hands hanging down from above.

Persona's focus on exploiting weaknesses returns in the
turn-based combat, but it has some new wrinkles. Should you land a critical or
hit a weak point, you get a boost, allowing that character to act first next
turn and reducing the move cost to zero SP or HP.  This plays into your strategy, but it also
means you're not constantly leaving the dungeon to heal up. Persona fusion also
becomes even more vital, as most characters can be equipped with a sub-persona
that provides additional special moves and more HP and SP. You're creating new
Personas for more than one character, which keeps you hooked on the fun fusion
system, getting to test out more Personas than ever before.
Boss battles can be intense affairs, but they also have
their own creative spins. For instance, I battled with a priest-like creature,
who vowed that I couldn't use a certain attack or item. If I did, I would be
severely punished by having a bunch of stat penalties and ailments unleashed on
my disobedient character. As the difficulty escalates, expect instant death
attacks and the need to constantly improve your Persona to survive. I loved
constantly adjusting my strategy; I never felt safe, so I never took any turns
for granted. 
Getting through dungeons isn't about merely surviving, but
also requires smart thinking. Sometimes this includes solving switch puzzles,
other times it's about reading cryptic clues to find your next move. Many of
these, especially those in later dungeons, give you so little to work with that
I imagine many people will have to consult a guide. At the very least, if you
ceaselessly wander without a solution, some characters will provide clues or
even offer to solve them for you. I wish you had the option to turn off or
reduce encounters while you figure them out, as it's distracting getting thrown
into battles as you try to piece things together. My only other complaint is a
little too much reliance on backtracking, but it's never too daunting. 
The reward loop is also well done. Like Etrian Odyssey, you
collect items from defeating monsters and then sell them to the shop to unlock
better items. Tackling a deadly FOE is even more satisfying, since you also get
a higher-level Persona than you're able to fuse. Side quests hold a similar
lure as you often receive a great deal of experience and quality items. They're
also varied and often provide additional story. One had me facing off against
Elizabeth from the Velvet Room, while another involved arranging a meet-up for
Junpei with the Persona 4 girls to hilarious results. 
Persona Q is easily one of my favorite games this year. It delivers in both quality gameplay and
wonderful characters, but what stands out is the extra effort that went into
every area, always raising the bar.

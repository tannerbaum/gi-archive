  TBS To Air Celebrity Street Fighter V Tournament






Television network TBS is currently in the midst of the third season of its eLeague program, which follows the competitive world of eSports. After two seasons in the world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, season three has been all about Capcom's latest head-to-head fighter, Street Fighter V.
The eLeague Street Fighter V Invitational Celebrity Showdown is a one-off special which will feature four celebrities facing off in a single-elimination tournament of Street Fighter V. The competitors are:

NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal
Grammy winner Lupe Fiasco
NFL running back Reggie Bush
WWE star Natalie Eva Marie

The contestants will compete for the $45,000 pot, with the winner receiving a majority of the money for a charity of their choice, and the remaining players getting less money for their worthy causes.

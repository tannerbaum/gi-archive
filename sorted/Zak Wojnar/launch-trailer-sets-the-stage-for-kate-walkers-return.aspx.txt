Thirteen years after Syberia II, the long-awaited third entry in the series is finally upon us.
Syberia 3 picks up right where its predecessor left off, with Kate Walker setting off on a new adventure alongside members of the Youkol tribe. Along the way, she will make friends and enemies, and presumably solve a bunch of complex puzzles, with the 3D graphics hopefully breathing new life into the point-and-click adventure genre. Check out the dramatic launch trailer below:

Syberia 3 comes out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on April 25, and for Nintendo Switch later in 2017. For more on the latest game from Benoit Sokal, check out an earlier trailer and hands-on impressions of how Syberia's classic adventure gameplay has been updated for modern sensibilities.

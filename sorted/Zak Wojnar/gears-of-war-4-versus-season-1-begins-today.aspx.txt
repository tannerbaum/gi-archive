  The First Season Of Gears of War 4 Versus Begins Today






One of the most popular games on Xbox One is Gears of War 4, and its multiplayer suite is getting a shot in the arm with the long-awaited implementation of Seasons.
Season 1 of Gears of War 4 multiplayer begins today; along with an overhaul to the skill-based matchmaking algorithms, combatants should now be pitted against more evenly matched opponents. Seasons will last around three months (this first season is due to expire in mid-July) and offer exclusive rewards in the form of fancy-looking weapon skins, awarded for reaching high ranks in various modes. Additionally, next week will see the launch of a Ranked Stats tracker, so players can see detailed reports on their progress from season to season.

Our TakeGears of War has a fun solo/co-op story mode, but its competitive multiplayer is what keeps players coming back for years after release. Rocket League made a strong showing with its seasonal approach to versus matchmaking, so it's cool to see GoW4 applying a similar tact; this way noobs like me will be less likely to get stuck in matches against hardcore champions. I'm content to splash around in the shallow end of the pool, so to speak.

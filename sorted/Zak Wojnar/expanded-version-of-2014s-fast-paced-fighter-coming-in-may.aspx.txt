Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2


  Expanded Version Of 2014's Fast-Paced Fighter Coming In May




Guilty Gear has been delivering solid, 2D fighting with an anime aesthetic since the original game hit the PlayStation all the way back in 1998. Now, nearly twenty years later, the latest iteration in the long-running one-on-one fighter has a release date on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
The amusingly-titled Guilty Gear Xrd: Rev 2 hits physical and digital shelves on May 26. This updated version of 2014's Xrd: Revelator will be available as a stand-alone purchase for $39.99, or as a digital upgrade to the original Revelator for $19.99. Rev 2 includes the original's previously-released DLC and adds new moves, stages, and characters, as well as expanded Arcade and Story modes. The whole game has been rebalanced from the bottom up, and is sure to provide a whole new experience for hardcore fans of the franchise.

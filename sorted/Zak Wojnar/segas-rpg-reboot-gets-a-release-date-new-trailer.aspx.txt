Valkyria Revolution


  Sega's RPG Spinoff Gets A Release Date And New Trailer




Following the success of Valkyria Chronicles Remastered last year, Sega is bringing the latest entry in the cult tactical action-RPG series to the West.
Valkyria Revolution isn't a sequel to the main Valkyria Chronicles storyline; though Sega is describing the title as a spinoff, with a new timeline and setting, though the series mythology, of ragnite ore and all-powerful Valkyria, remains in the new title. Bits of the story, as well as the new, faster-paced battle system, are on full display in a new trailer:

The new Valkyria title is getting physical and digital releases on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while the Vita version is only receiving a digital release.
Valkyria Revolution comes out on June 27. For more on the game, check out an earlier trailer. If you haven't played the original Valkyria Chronicles yet, perhaps this bizarre hour-long unboxing video of the 2016 remaster will convince you...

  PlayStation Plus Free Games For May Include Abzu, Tales From The Borderlands






Now that a new month is nearly upon us, Sony has announced the new games being added to their PlayStation Plus lineup.
The marquee titles this month are Telltale's Tales from the Borderlands, the narrative-focused spin-off of Gearbox's popular shoot-and-loot FPS RPG series, and Abzu, the undersea indie adventure with stunning visuals. Other new additions include Laser Disco Defenders, a unique top-down shooter where fired shots ricochet forever, becoming hazards for the player to avoid, and Port Royale 3, the strategic pirate economy simulator. Check out the complete list below:

Tales from the Borderlands – PS4
Abzu – PS4
Port Royale 3: Pirates and Merchants – PS3
Blood Knights – PS3
Laser Disco Defenders – Vita (Cross Buy on PS4)
Type: Rider – Vita (Cross Buy on PS4)

Of course, each new set of games brings about the end of last month's lineup; time is running out to pick up Drawn to Death and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.
The new games will arrive when the PlayStation Store next update hits on May 2. For more, check out our comparison of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Games With Gold.

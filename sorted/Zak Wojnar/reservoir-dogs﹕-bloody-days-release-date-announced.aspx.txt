A new game based on the movie Reservoir Dogs is coming out in May. Weird, right? What's even weirder is that it actually looks kind of awesome, like Hotline Miami with a unique time-rewind mechanic.

Sure, none of the characters remotely resemble their movie counterparts, but if the gameplay proves to be solid enough to hold up after hours of play, then Bloody Days could prove to be the unexpected breakout hit of the summer.

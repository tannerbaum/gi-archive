  Free Swimsuit DLC Out Now For Persona 5






Persona 5 has been out for a few weeks, and the PlayStation Store is already host to a slew of DLC for the critically acclaimed JRPG, mostly in the form of cosmetic options for the main cast.
To celebrate the success of the latest entry in the long-running series, the most recent batch of costumes includes a free bonus. The Swimsuit Set is free and allows players to deck out their crew in stylish beachwear. It's ridiculous, but who are we to argue with free content? Besides, if it's too silly for you, there's the Regular Clothes & School Uniforms Set from April 11, which is also free, to say nothing of the tons of premium costumes available for purchase, including an upcoming set based on Atlus's cult hit Catherine, due next week.
Persona 5 is out now on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. For more, check out our review, and a rundown on the basics of the series.

Playtonic is a team composed of ex-Rare developers who worked on legendary platformers like Banzo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. It's fitting then, that their first title is an old-school throwback to the glory days of the mascot platformer. Yooka-Laylee wears its inspiration on its sleeve, and a new video from the team explores Playtonic's process of updating their classic mechanics for modern audiences.

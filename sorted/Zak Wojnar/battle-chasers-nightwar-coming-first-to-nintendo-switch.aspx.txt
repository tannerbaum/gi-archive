Original Story: During today's Nintendo Direct, it was revealed that the upcoming RPG, Battle Chasers: Nightwar, will be a timed exclusive for Nintendo Switch.
After successfully raising over $800,000 during its 2015 Kickstarter campaign, the title was announced for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and now the title is not only making its way to Nintendo's popular console/handheld hybrid, but will also be temporarily exclusive to the Switch.
Battle Chasers: Nightwar will release on Nintendo Switch in "late summer," with other versions to follow sometime afterwards.

Lara Croft Go first released on smartphones in 2015 before being ported to Steam and PlayStation in December 2016. Curiously, mobile platforms are the last to receive this final expansion, which was included in the initial PlayStation 4 and Vita port of the title. The DLC released on PC last week, and is now free on iOS. There's no word yet on when the expansion will hit Android systems.

Rock Band VR


  Performance Mode Gameplay Trailer And Release Details




The rhythm genre may not be as hugely popular as it was in its heyday of 2007-09, but there is still an audience out there who loves to rock out on their plastic instruments. Rock Band 4's steady stream of DLC is showing no signs of stopping, and Online Quckplay mode just released to owners of the Rivals Expansion. In addition to this, developer Harmonix is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the series with a brand-new title exclusive to Oculus Rift: Rock Band VR.

Rock Band VR is a guitar-only game compatible with any PS4 or Xbox One Rock Band 4 controller (no legacy instruments allowed at present, sorry!). Players will strap on the Oculus headset and be transported to a virtual-reality concert stage where they can rock out in two distinct modes: Classic Mode retains the classic Rock Band five-button beatmatching gameplay, while Performance Mode takes full advantage of the immersive nature of Oculus VR. A natural extension of Rock Band 4's Freestyle Solos, Performance Mode lets players put their own spin on 60 rock and roll tunes. Three tracks have been announced so far:

The Killers – "When You Were Young"
Aerosmith – "Walk This Way"
Paramore – "Ain't It Fun"

Rock Band VR releases on March 23 for Oculus Rift on PC and is available to pre-order now. The Amazon bundle retails for $69.99 and includes a digital copy of the game as well as a Rock Band 4 Fender Stratocaster guitar controller.

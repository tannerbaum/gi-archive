  New TumbleSeed Trailer Reveals Release Date






TumbleSeed, the unique "Rolly Roguelike" indie title, releases this May.
The game was a standout indie at GDC 2017, and it offers a unique gameplay hook unlike anything else on the market. Based on the 1980s mechanical arcade game Ice Cold Beer, TumbleSeed has players navigating procedurally-generated stages by balancing a marble-like "seed" and avoiding an endless barrage of difficult obstacles.

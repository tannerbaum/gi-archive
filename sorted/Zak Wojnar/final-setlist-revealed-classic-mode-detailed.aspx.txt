Rock Band VR is just a week away, and Harmonix has just revealed final batch of songs which will be present at launch.
The virtual reality rock and roll simulator will contain 60 songs on day one, and the company plans to support the rhythm game with post-launch DLC; Six songs by Aerosmith (including "Ragdoll" and "Janie's Got a Gun") will be available from the Oculus Store for $2.99 each.
Finally, while we've already detailed how Rock Band VR shakes up the traditional Rock Band formula with its performance-based scoring, old-school fans of the franchise will be pleased to learn that the original five-button guitar gameplay is still an important part of the game. Classic Mode is the Rock Band we all know and love, but with an extra touch of virtual reality immersion thanks to the Oculus headset.

  Game Informer's Top Scoring Reviews Of 2018






            Each year, the Game Informer staff reviews a ton of games. Despite hundreds of games coming across our desks each year, only a select few are able to obtain special commendations reserved for the highest scoring titles. Games that earn an 8.5 or 8.75 obtain a Game Informer Silver award, while a score ranging from 9 to 9.5 earns that game a Game Informer Gold award. While most of the best games of the year fall into that range, the most elite titles ascend to the next level to earn a Game Informer Platinum award (9.75 or 10 score).

To help you keep track of the best of the best, we've compiled all of the top scoring games of 2018 here. Check out the games we've thought are the best of the year so far, and if you want to learn more, you can read the full review with a simple click-through.

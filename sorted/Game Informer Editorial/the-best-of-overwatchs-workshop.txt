  The Best Of Overwatch's Workshop






Overwatch players can now dream up new hero powers and make changes to the base game using the Workshop, an in-game scripting system that opens up customization of the game's rules, conditions, and actions. The best part of the Workshop: All of the players' creations end up in the Game Browser. 

We've rounded up some of the coolest and most creative Workshop creations that we've seen, and will continue updating this article with new ones when we run across them. If you know of some that you think belong on this list, mention them in the comments and we'll check them out.

  Game Informer Staff Shares Their Top 10 Games Of 2018






Every year, the team at Game Informer closes things out with a series of long, contentious meetings to determine the staff's picks for the best games of the that calendar year. As the video game industry continues to churn out tons of great games, the picks for each category rarely come easy. This year was no exception. While the staff argued to see their favorite games make the various lists, the reality is not everyone's picks received the recognition they feel it deserved. Thankfully, we can shine a spotlight on these titles through each editor's personal top 10 list.

Below you'll find every editor at Game Informer's personal top 10 list for 2018. While some games appear on nearly every list, this gives you an idea of which hidden gems each editor was hoping the team would choose to recognize at the end of the year. Check out the lists below and see which editor your tastes most aligned with in 2018.

For our 2018 Game of the Year awards, head here.

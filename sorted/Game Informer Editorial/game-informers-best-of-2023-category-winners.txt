  Game Informer's Best Of 2023: Category Winners






            Before the year concluded, discussions were already percolating about whether 2023 was the best year for video game releases ever. It was a challenging year for the industry as a whole, but in terms of artistic output, 2023 is absolutely a contender. Whittling the year's releases to a mere 10 games was challenging, but we did it (you can read our top 10 right here).

However, the year's game release calendar was so much more than just those 10 games. Below, you'll see our winners for various categories, allowing us to celebrate a wide range of games, moments, characters, and elements from the extremely strong year for game releases.

            Best Combat – Armored Core VI Fires Of Rubicon

            Armored Core VI’s combat is defined by grace. Despite its blistering pace, you never feel out of control. The game constantly flexes around how you want to approach the tools you bring onto the battlefield, only building upon the highly responsive combat mechanics, making for an experience that feels authored by you.

            Best Original Score – Final Fantasy XVI

            The bar for Final Fantasy music is high, but its most recent entry has exceeded it. From explosive boss fights to quiet moments at the hideaway, the music team for Final Fantasy XVI fired on all cylinders. The score enhances the best parts of the game, and it’s one we’ll be humming for years to come.

            Best Hero – Clive Rosfield (Final Fantasy XVI)

            Clive is more than a stereotypical brooding hero. A gripping backstory and a passionate performance by actor Ben Starr set him apart from other protagonists. In a setting like Valisthea, the audience needs a lodestar to guide them through the complex world. Clive fills that role beautifully.

            Best Villain – Ganondorf (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom)

            We’ve been fighting permutations of Ganon for decades at this point, but The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s version stands out among his peers. He had a voice for the first time, and with his immortal, dehydrated form, we don’t know that he’s ever looked scarier. The final confrontation may also be our favorite Ganondorf fight ever.

            Best Dork – Chai (Hi-Fi Rush)

            Chai’s wannabe attitude is more than a personality trait – it’s the tone driving the whole game forward. The cartoonish presentation pairs perfectly with his cheesy grin and constant wisecracking. Facepalms and eyerolls at his excessive enthusiasm cement his Best Dork victory.

            What begins as a catastrophic city-scale fight with the Bahamut Eikon escalates to the cosmic scale, pitting gods against each other to the backdrop of space, with awe-inspiring visuals and stunning sequences to match. In a year with some truly excellent boss battles, Final Fantasy XVI’s fight with the king of dragons soars above the rest.

            Best Developer – Nintendo

            The iconic company gave us our Game of the Year, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and delivered one of the best 2D Mario games in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Add Pikmin 4 and more to that already great concoction, and Nintendo’s year was nearly impossible to top.

            Best Publisher – Capcom

            Capcom was on its game in 2023, successfully remaking the already stellar Resident Evil 4, launching the best fighting game of the year in Street Fighter 6, and surprising skeptics with the entertaining Exoprimal. Capcom’s renaissance shows no signs of slowing down.

            Best Remake – Resident Evil 4

            The Resident Evil 4 remake seemed like an impossible task. How do you remake one of the best — and most important — games of all time? Luckily, Capcom was up to the task. Resident Evil 4 is paced down to the second to be a fun, thrilling, and scary adaptation of its source material, becoming one of the best games of its era in its own right.

            Best Action Game – Marvel’s Spider-Man 2

            Insomniac’s Spider-Man games already boasted great action, but between Peter and Miles’ distinct arsenals of symbiote and venom powers, plus a helpful parry mechanic, combat reaches its zenith in Spider-Man 2. The incredible web-swinging/gliding steals the show; simply getting around is as exciting as a big boss fight or setpiece, if not more so. The result is a superpowered thrill ride unlike any other.

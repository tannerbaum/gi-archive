  Our Most Anticipated Horror Games Of 2019 






            The horror genre went into hiding in 2018, but is poised to return in a big way this year, beginning with the release of Resident Evil 2 on January 25. The year ahead is chock-full of new intellectual properties that are delivering suspense and gore through unconventional narrative directions. From ancient Nordic horrors to disappearances in Roswell, gamers have plenty of interesting scares coming their way. In assembling this anticipated list, we looked at over 40 horror games slated for 2019, and narrowed it to the nine that we believe look the most promising.

Note: Entries are listed in alphabetical order.

Apsulov: End of Gods

Release: 2019
Platform: PC

Whenever you dig up an artifact that defies logic, you have to ask yourself why it was buried in the first place. In Apsulov: End of Gods, a horror game from Angry Demon Studio, you uncover something a device that aims to bring destruction to Midgard (the human realm). Described as a "future viking horror game," Apsulov blends Nordic mythology with science fiction, and pushes the player to prevent an ancient horror from destroying the world and perhaps reawakening the Nordic Gods.

The Beast Inside

Release: 2019
Platform: PC

A cryptanalyst discovered a clue from a murder that occurred more than 100 years ago, and now finds himself hunted by what appears to be the same killer. He must piece together this murder from the Civil War era to end the current threat. To do this, players will control two characters, one set in the past and one in the present, within a small open world where every item is interactive. Given one of the character's professions, solving puzzles and deciphering codes is a huge part of the game, but you'll also have a gun that can deal with the threats that emerge. The Beast Inside is currently just listed as "coming soon" from developer Illusion Ray Studio.

The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan

Release: 2019
Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

Supermassive Games, the studio behind the excellent choice-driven slasher game Until Dawn, has numerous horror stories to tell and plans to release them as an anthology. The first story, which looks to be designed similarly to Until Dawn from a gameplay perspective, is called Man of Medan. Set in the South Pacific, a group of four young Americans and their boat's captain stumble upon a World War II vessel and decide to investigate it. They don't like what they find, but end up being trapped on the vessel due to a storm. They need to figure out how to escape before the boat's occupants cut them down.

Layers of Fear 2

Release: 2019
Platform: TBA

Drawing inspiration from the works of Alfred Hitchcock, Bloober Team's Layers of Fear sequel will have more of a classic film quality to it, but will still focus on art and making players second guess what they are seeing. Narrated by Tony Todd, who was Candyman in Candyman, Layers of Fear 2 doesn't have a release window other than 2019, nor platform listings yet, although it's a safe bet it will be on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Those answers may come tomorrow at the game's PAX South panel.

Pathologic 2

Release: 2019
Platform: PC

The original Pathologic assumed immediate cult-classic status when it released in 2005. The game was buggy and ugly to look at but its ambitions, casting you as a group of characters trying to prevent a plague from decimating a small town, were astonishing for the time. Its village had NPCs who went about their own schedules, timed quests, a ridiculous amount of branching paths, and an unspeakably bleak and horrific atmosphere. With Pathologic 2, which is a remake of the original game, perhaps developer Ice-Pick Lodge will deliver on the bold innovations of the first game with a needed facelift to creep out a whole new generation of gamers.

A standalone prequel is available as a demo that you can download here.

The Peterson Case

Release: 2019
Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

A family has gone missing near Roswell, New Mexico, and you are a detective who has been called in to figure out what happened to them. Investigating their house may sound like a great place to start, but it could spell your end. The house is crawling with unnatural things, including ghosts, living symbols on the walls, and perhaps even proof that we are not along in this universe. The good news: You have a pretty good idea of what happened to the family, which also happens to be one of the greatest discoveries of our time. The bad news: You're probably going to die or disappear in this house, just like the family.

Resident Evil 2

Release: January 25
Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

A remake of the 1998 PlayStation game, Resident Evil 2 reunites gamers with Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who find themselves trapped in Raccoon City at the height of a zombie outbreak. While much of the story and locations players visit will seem familiar, the gameplay and puzzles have been completely reworked, including a much-needed over-the-shoulder targeting system. After spending hours playing it, Game Informer's Imran Khan says, "I went into the Resident Evil 2 remake looking to recapture that same feeling, but found that Capcom wasnâ€™t trying to recreate a moment-in-time with the horror revival as much as they were trying to recontextualize it."

The Sinking City

Release: March 21
Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

Developer Frogwares has a long history of making Sherlock Holmes investigation games, but is now turning its gaze to the works of H.P. Lovecraft for the studio's next game, The Sinking City. Set in Oakmont, Massachusetts, in the 1920s, and seen through the eyes of investigator Charles W. Reed, players must figure out why the entire city is going mad. We all know the answer has something to do with Cthulhu, but Reed doesn't, and you're going to need to help him keep his sanity as he explores an open world that is flooding. Much like the Sherlock Holmes games, you'll be interrogating people and studying the environment to find clues. The game also features combat and action sequences.

Unholy

Release: 2019
Platform: PC

Described as first-person stealth/horror, Unholy takes a mother named Saidah through the last city of a dying planet to locate her missing daughter. Players will have to determine how they approach each scenario, either with stealth or taking out the guards that stand in your way. Developer Duality Games says that each play style has its own consequences. We don't know what this means yet, but it could tie into the need to keep Saidah's physical and mental health in check. She could go insane if you play your cards wrong.

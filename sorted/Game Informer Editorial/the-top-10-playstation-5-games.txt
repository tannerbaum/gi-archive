  The Top 10 PlayStation 5 Games






            Ever since the PS5 launched in 2020, people have wanted to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5's power and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5's absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.

Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, with future updates, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped over time, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re already caught up on the latest hits.

Here are Game Informer’s picks for the top 10 games on PlayStation 5:

            Marvel's Spider-Man 2

            Release: October 20, 2023

            Coming off an incredible second act in its Spider-Man series starring Miles Morales, Insomniac Games had its work cut out for it. Thankfully, the studio was beyond capable, delivering one of the greatest superhero video games of all time with Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Swinging through New York while in pursuit of iconic foes remains as amazing as it was in the first two games, but it's the additional moves and traversal options (including the game-changing web wings) that make this the stand out entry in one of PlayStation's most beloved exclusive franchises. | Our Review

            Baldur's Gate 3

            Release: September 6, 2023

            The role-playing video game emerged from the dream of being able to go on a Dungeons & Dragons-style adventure with the convenience and immersion that only video game consoles and computers can offer. Perhaps no game has better captured that fantasy than Baldur's Gate 3. Complete with a built-in DM, story-altering player choices, and front-facing d20 rolls – not to mention the ability to play cooperatively with your friends – Baldur's Gate 3 is the electronic D&D experience players have been waiting decades for, and delivers one of the greatest RPGs in recent memory. | Our Review

            Resident Evil 4

            Release: March 24, 2023

            Following two well-received remakes of its second and third mainline entries, the Resident Evil franchise did the impossible: It took its most beloved entry and made it even better. Resident Evil 4 could have been a complete disaster; trying to update such a revolutionary game has many pitfalls. Thankfully, Capcom masterfully dodged them to deliver a tense, action-packed experience that would make you believe that Resident Evil 4 actually came out in 2023, while simultaneously reinforcing why the original game from nearly two decades ago was so important. | Our Review

            God of War Ragnarök

            Release: November 9, 2022

            When 2018's God of War turned the series upside-down by changing the action, combat, pacing, and its hero's emotional range – all to widespread critical and fan acclaim – many wondered how Sony Santa Monica could possibly top its accomplishment. The answer was God of War Ragnarök, a sequel that stunningly pushes forward the gameplay, narrative, and characters. Following Kratos and Atreus' adventures through Norse mythology is a blast, while the meaningful evolutions of both the puzzle-solving, world exploration, and combat cement it as one of the best action games available on PlayStation 5 today. | Our Review

            Elden Ring

            Release: February 25, 2022

            The wait for Elden Ring was excruciating, but it was nothing compared to the trials and challenges that awaited us when From Software finally delivered its masterpiece to the masses. But those who persevere through the studio's trademark difficulty are handsomely rewarded with incredibly tight combat mechanics, rewarding exploration, and one of the greatest open-world action games ever crafted. Elden Ring smacked us down with its daunting boss battles and unfathomably massive world time and time again, but we kept lining up for more punishment with smiles on our faces, and we loved it so much that we awarded it a rare 10 out of 10 review score and it was an easy choice for Game of the Year 2022. | Our Review

            Deathloop

            Release: September 14, 2021

            Arkane Studios, the makers of Dishonored and 2017’s Prey, combined its immersive sim expertise with a groovy sci-fi 1970s aesthetic to create an engrossing time-looping adventure. As Colt Vahn, you’re stranded on an island trapped within a 24-hour time loop. To break the cycle, you must eliminate the island’s eight visionaries in one day while dodging the sniper fire of Julianna, a rival assassin that an anonymous human player can control. Deathloop is as much a puzzle game as it is action, as figuring out how to eliminate your targets before midnight requires uncovering and connecting clues about their behavior and movements to determine the time and place to strike. Deathloop presents several ways to commit your dirty deeds, and a suite of fun supernatural abilities complement your wacky firearms. | Our Review

            Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut

            Release: August 20, 2021

            This samurai epic wowed players on PlayStation 4, and the Director’s Cut leverages the PS5 to make the game look and perform better than ever. Cutting down invading Mongols as samurai Jin Sakai has never felt better, and riding across Tsushima’s scenic flower fields in dynamic 4K is a sight to behold. On top of welcomed additions like 3D audio and full Japanese lip sync, the Director’s Cut also includes the Iki Island story expansion. Set on a small neighboring island plagued by a supernatural threat, this addition almost feels big enough to be a standalone sequel. It’s a great bonus that perfectly complements the primary campaign, giving Ghost of Tsushima fans an excellent excuse to extend their island revenge quest. | Our Review

            Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart

            Release: June 11, 2021

            Ratchet & Clank is a pillar of the PlayStation brand, and the franchise’s latest entry, Rift Apart, offers a great reminder of why that’s the case. The topsy turvy story sees the duo battle Dr. Nefarious across a multiverse, specifically, a dimension where the villain has conquered the galaxy. Rivet, a female counterpart to Ratchet, joins as a welcome co-star in a story chock full of humor and heart. Meanwhile, the blend of platforming and gunplay is tighter and more dazzling than ever. Using the rift tether to warp between realities seamlessly offers a unique wrinkle to combat and exploration. It also helps that Rift Apart is a graphical showcase, giving you the perfect title to show off the PS5’s horsepower. | Our Review

            Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade

            Release: June 10, 2021

            2020’s Final Fantasy VII Remake accomplished the impossible feat of recapturing the intangible essence that makes the 1997 game so beloved while reinventing the story and gameplay to make it feel like a new title. If you missed it the first time, FFVII Remake introduces a winning blend of fast-paced action and turn-based-style mechanics to please players on both sides of the coin. As the first chapter of an episodic journey, the story centers on Cloud and his friends as they try to take down the evil Shinra corporation, spanning the entire Midgar section of the original adventure. Intergrade, the enhanced PS5 edition, made the already stunning PS4 game look even better. Best of all, it includes the console-exclusive Intermission story chapter starring the charismatic ninja Yuffie along with an even better spin on the already stellar combat system. | Our Review

            As both a fast-paced third-person shooter and an atmospheric, mysterious journey through alien horror, Returnal succeeds at delivering an incredibly competent and cohesive experience. Returnal takes advantage of all that next-gen gaming has to offer, including comprehensive feedback from the DualSense controller. With adrenaline-fueled and creative boss fights, hundreds and hundreds of impressive “bullet-hell” projectiles to dodge, and an assortment of impressive weapons to experiment with, Returnal keeps you enthralled to the very end. | Our Review

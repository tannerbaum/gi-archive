  Top 10 Metroidvanias To Play Right Now






            Whether you call them Metroid-likes, exploration-based action platformers, big map adventures, or simply Metroidvanias, this sub-genre has exploded in popularity. What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in. 

            Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC

            Whether in 2D or 3D, the Prince of Persia series has always emphasized exceptional platforming and smooth traversal. The Lost Crown dials these tenets up to 11. Exploring as the warrior Sargon is exhilarating thanks to the fast-paced platforming and equally fine-tuned (and surprisingly deep) combat. A suite of time-manipulation powers make uncovering the massive, secret-filled city of Mount Qaf a joy. Overcoming a litany of varied, deviously designed platforming gauntlets tested our skills in the best way and, most importantly, made us feel cool. Smart navigational features, such as the ability to screenshot obstacles for reference, make the genre's inherent focus on backtracking much more palatable. When the credits rolled, we wished we could rewind time and experience Sargon's quest for the first time again. | Our Review

            Blasphemous 2

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC

            By transposing the trademark difficulty, boss design, and combat intensity of the Soulslike category to the 2D Metroidvania genre, Blasphemous 2 achieves something special. With supremely tight controls and a host of special abilities to aid you, persistent players will slowly but surely overcome the most daunting of tasks. Add to that extremely thoughtful exploration of the nonlinear, labyrinthine map chockful of all the impeding trappings of Metroidvanias and Blasphemous 2 is one to put on your radar if you're not opposed to challenging your skills. | Our Review

            Metroid Dread

            Switch

            It's fitting that Samus' latest adventure ranks among the best of the genre she pioneered. Metroid Dread may have taken 19 years to see the light of day, but it was worth the wait. Dread features the classic side-scrolling action, top-notch level design, and modern improvements that developer MercurySteam introduced in Metroid: Samus Returns but adds a terrifying twist. Nigh-invincible robots called E.M.M.I.'s stalk the bounty hunter and can annihilate her on sight, forcing players to evade them or hide using Samus' new cloaking ability. This adds a tense and sometimes scary wrinkle to the superb action exploration that put the franchise on the map. It also makes it all the more satisfying when you eventually turn the tables on E.M.M.I.'s with an upgraded arm cannon (though besting these formidable machines is still easier said than done). Metroid Dread may serve as the conclusion to Samus' decades-long conflict with the Metroids, but we hope future 2D entries build upon its winning formula. | Our Review

            Ori and the Will of the Wisps

            Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC

            Will of the Wisps improves upon Ori’s first adventure in every way and then some. The already jaw-dropping presentation somehow looks even better, traditional auto-saves replace the original’s weird soul links system, and it feels smoother than silk on the sticks. The acrobatic platforming feels fantastic, and that’s good because you’ll be doing a lot of it thanks to high-stakes escape sequences that push your skills to their limits. Combat plays a more prominent role this time around, with Ori bringing the hurt with satisfying melee strikes. If failing a white-knuckle platforming sequence doesn’t make you cry, Will of the Wisps’ tear-jerking story and sympathetic antagonist ensures there won’t be a dry eye in the house once you reach its dramatic climax. | Our Review

            Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night

            PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, Android

            Bloodstained may as well be called “Castlevania: Symphony of the Night 2”. After all, it comes from Symphony’s mastermind and Castlevania luminary Koji Igarashi and carries many of the series’ classic elements while introducing cool new ideas on top. Players explore a gothic castle overflowing with secrets while slaying supernatural foes using weapons such as swords, axes, and, of course, a whip. Killing enemies feels extra rewarding since they drop shards that bestow cool powers that can turn the tide of battle. The more shards you collect, the more comprehensive your ability pool to create multiple loadouts suited for any situation. When you aren’t fighting the forces of darkness, you help surviving townsfolk by completing bounties, farming crops, cooking recipes, and other engaging diversions. Best of all, a ton of post-launch updates have only sweetened Bloodstained’s package. If you’ve been dying for something more “Vania” than Metroid, Bloodstained is a must-play. | Our Review

            Yoku's Island Express

            PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC

            Want some pinball with your Metroidvania? Yoku’s Island Express is for you. This imaginative title gives you control of a mail-delivering dung beetle tethered to a ball of poop that you fling around a vibrant world using pinball-style flippers, bumpers, and ramps. Excellent level design means flippers are precisely where you need them to be, and like real pinball, hitting shots at the right angle can send Yoku down secret paths accessible only to the most skilled wizards. It may be pinball, but you still indulge in plenty of path-opening, sidequests, as well as a narrative that ups the ante on gameplay as it unfolds. Yoku’s ingenious blend of seemingly disparate ideas makes it stand out amongst an increasingly crowded genre. | Our Review 

            Iconoclasts

            PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PlayStation Vita, PC

            Iconoclasts’ action rocks, but it won many over for its surprisingly mature story tackling faith and the dangers of religious zealotry. The tale stars Robin, a simple mechanic defending her free will and that of her friends against the theocratic rule of an oppressive regime. The strong supporting cast and eye-widening plot twists hook you until the end and should have you reflecting on the adventure long after the credits rolled. Traversing the well-designed world requires solving clever environmental puzzles that challenge players to use their skillset in increasingly ingenious ways. That inventive design extends to a rogue’s gallery of imaginative boss battles. Boasting great action, a wonderful presentation, and a thoughtful narrative, Iconoclasts is the total package. | Our Review 

            SteamWorld Dig 2

            PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PlayStation Vita, 3DS, Stadia, PC

            The shorthand way to describe SteamWorld Dig 2 is “Better than SteamWorld Dig 1 in every way”. The game remains a compelling loop of digging underground to find treasures, returning above-ground to purchase upgrades, and going back down to see how much further you can dig. Chasing the next cool upgrade or useful ability causes the hours to melt away, and new powers are doled out at the perfect pace. A flexible cog system lets players freely experiment with several neat perks to tackle whatever obstacle lies ahead. Superb puzzle-solving breaks up the routine of digging. Combat, while not perfect, gets the job done well enough. SteamWorld Dig 2 packs a ton of great ideas into a tight package and shouldn’t be missed whether you played the original or not. | Our Review

            Hollow Knight

            PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC

            Hollow Knight boasts engaging combat, a haunting beauty, and a delicious difficulty that makes it one of the most beloved entries on this list. Players control a diminutive knight fighting to keep a kingdom of sapient bugs from falling to a devastating infection. Combat feels great, and flexible upgrades encourage you to tinker with different builds to tackle an assortment of tough-as-nails enemies and intimidating bosses. Finding and purchasing a map to see the world can be annoying, but it forces you to internalize the eye-catching world. Hollow Knight’s skill ceiling may be higher than the average Metroidvania, but it rewards patience and skill with an engrossing adventure that continually gets better throughout its lengthy runtime. There’s a reason fans come running when even the slightest mention of the long-in-development sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, hits the airwaves. | Our Review

            Axiom Verge

            PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, PlayStation Vita, PC

            This love letter to Super Metroid recaptures that eerie sense of isolation but is by no means a retread. As Trace, you’re transported to an alien world following a failed experiment, and the only way to survive is to collect a staggering arsenal of guns to blast through an assortment of bizarre enemies. No two weapons are alike, and every firearm seems tailored to combat certain foes. One fires bouncing artillery. Another shoots wall-patrolling buzzsaws. There’s even a weapon that can distort reality itself. Perhaps nothing demonstrates Axiom Verge’s creativity better than your signature address gun, a tool that causes enemies and environments to “glitch”, altering their behavior and physical makeup entirely. Another highlight is the fascinating story that serves as the first chapter of a carefully planned mythos that continues in the recently released Axiom Verge 2. | Our Review

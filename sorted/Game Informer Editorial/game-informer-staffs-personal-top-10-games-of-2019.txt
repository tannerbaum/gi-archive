  Game Informer Staff's Personal Top 10 Games Of 2019






            Each year, the staff at Game Informer collectively plays through hundreds of games to have a deep and broad view of the industry so we can tell you which games are most worth your hard-earned spare time and money. At the end of the year, we compile our favorite games into our Top 50, which was published in our most recent issue. While that list is a result of long arguments from every editor on staff, there's just no mathematical way for each of our favorite games to make the cut.

That's why we also keep track of each editor's personal favorite games of the year. Below you'll find every editor on staff along with their top 10 games of 2019.

What are your favorite games from last year? Which editor did your 2019 favorites most align with? Let us know in the comments!

  Editor Top 10 Picks 2021






            Earlier, we announced Game Informer's official Top 10 Games of 2021, but that list doesn't paint the whole picture. That list was compiled after a hard-fought battle over many hours as we struggled to squeeze our collective favorites onto one official list. Unfortunately, many of our favorite games of the year couldn't be represented in the official Top Ten, which is why we put together these editor-specific top 10s.

Below you'll see the top 10 games of the year for each editor. Check out our personal favorites and see which staff members' tastes most align with yours. While you're here, feel free to drop your own top 10 in the comments!

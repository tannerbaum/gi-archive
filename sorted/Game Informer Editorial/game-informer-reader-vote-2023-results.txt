  Game Informer Reader Vote 2023 Results






            This year represented one of the most difficult game of the year discussions we’ve had in some time; 2023 was overflowing with fantastic games. But our opinions are not the only ones (you can read Game Informer's top 2023 10 list right here). For a few weeks, beginning November 17, we ran a poll online, and readers sent their top five favorite games of 2023. We used ranked positional voting – the Borda count method – to gather the results below. If you have opinions on your opinions, leave us a comment below! But you can't be mad at us. This is all you.

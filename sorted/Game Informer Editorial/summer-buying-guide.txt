Nerf Rival Curve Shot Sideswipe

The Nerf arms race continues to escalate in the battle for dominance of your backyard. The special adjustable muzzle allows you to aim shots to curve around corners and trees to nail those tricky targets in your backyard battle.

Purchase

Backbone One Mobile Controller

Plenty of controllers connect to your phone to give a console-like play experience, but few have impressed us like the Backbone. This responsive controller connects to your iPhone for seamless play of any game that supports controller use. Low latency along with high-quality buttons and sticks are great, but the lightning port for pass-through charging, as well as the availability of gameplay recording, puts this in a different league. And since it draws very little battery power from your phone, you can take it on all your summer adventures and car rides. $99
Purchase

Duo 2-Person Double Hammock

Whether you’re looking for an innovative camping option or just hoping to play some portable games in comfort while hanging out in your backyard, this two-person hammock is stable, easy to set up, and features some smart design that keeps each person separate. There’s even underfloor nets to store books, tech, or keep other gear dry. $229
Purchase

Destiny Europa Tech Dark Facemask

Even as vaccines offer hope, it’s likely we'll still need masks in at least some situations. If you want your protective gear to sport a bit of video game style but like to keep things subtle, this Destiny-branded face mask recalls your adventures on the snowy Europa, but only fellow Guardians will be savvy enough to recognize the design. $20.00
Purchase

BigBlue 28W Solar Charger

If your love of the outdoors equals your love of tech, you’re inevitably faced with the dilemma of being separated from easy electrical charging. BigBlue’s Solar Charger resolves the conflict with an affordable and highly efficient solution, which folds up easily for backpack storage, but performs admirably to keep phones, tablets, and other USB chargeable devices up and running. $99

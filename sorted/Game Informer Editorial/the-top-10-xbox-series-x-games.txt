  The Top 10 Xbox Series X Games






            If you're the proud owner of an Xbox Series X, chances are, you are in the same boat as us: constantly pursuing the best games available for the platform. The team at Game Informer worked together to compile a list of the 10 games we think are the best on Xbox Series X/S. As more games come out, we'll update this list with the latest releases that we feel deserve to crack the top 10.

Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, with future updates, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped over time, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re already caught up on the latest hits.

Here are Game Informer’s picks for the top 10 games on Xbox Series X/S:

            Baldur's Gate 3

            Release: December 7, 2023

            The role-playing video game emerged from the dream of being able to go on a Dungeons & Dragons-style adventure with the convenience and immersion that only video game consoles and computers can offer. Perhaps no game has better captured that fantasy than Baldur's Gate 3. Complete with a built-in DM, story-altering player choices, and front-facing d20 rolls – not to mention the ability to play cooperatively with your friends – Baldur's Gate 3 is the electronic D&D experience players have been waiting decades for, and delivers one of the greatest RPGs in recent memory. | Our Review

            Alan Wake 2

            Release: October 27, 2023

            A sequel 13 years in the making, Alan Wake 2 delivers on so many fronts, demonstrating how much Remedy Entertainment has grown and evolved in the time since the original title arrived as an Xbox 360 exclusive in 2010. A masterfully woven narrative with an unparalleled sense of atmosphere is just the start of what makes Alan Wake 2 so great. To say too much would be to spoil the experience – and trust us, you want to go into this as unspoiled as possible – but through the mixing of live-action footage and in-game cinematics, Remedy pulled off something special that serves as the current magnum opus for the well-liked studio. | Our Review

            Resident Evil 4

            Release: March 24, 2023

            Following two well-received remakes of its second and third mainline entries, the Resident Evil franchise did the impossible: It took its most beloved entry and made it even better. Resident Evil 4 could have been a complete disaster; trying to update such a revolutionary game has many pitfalls. Thankfully, Capcom masterfully dodged them to deliver a tense, action-packed experience that would make you believe that Resident Evil 4 actually came out in 2023 while simultaneously reinforcing why the original game from nearly two decades ago was so important. | Our Review

            Hi-Fi Rush

            Release: January 25, 2023

            Hi-Fi Rush might not be the game that fans expected next from the studio that gave us Ghostwire: Tokyo and The Evil Within, but with this surprise launch, we saw what Tango Gameworks is truly capable of. This action/rhythm game brings in several big-name artists to complement its exciting and stylish combat, biting humor, and outstanding art direction. Since it's part of the Bethesda-published catalog, an added bonus is that it's available on Xbox Game Pass, making it an easy pick for the next game subscribers should download. | Our Review

            Elden Ring

            Release: February 25, 2022

            The wait for Elden Ring was excruciating, but it was nothing compared to the trials and challenges that awaited us when From Software finally delivered its masterpiece to the masses. But those who persevere through the studio's trademark difficulty are handsomely rewarded with incredibly tight combat mechanics, rewarding exploration, and one of the greatest open-world action games ever crafted. Elden Ring smacked us down with its daunting boss battles and unfathomably massive world time and time again, but we kept lining up for more punishment with smiles on our faces, and we loved it so much that we awarded it a rare 10 out of 10 review score and it was an easy choice for Game of the Year 2022. | Our Review

            Halo Infinite

            Release: December 8, 2021

            Halo Infinite is a genuine love letter to what originally made Halo, as a series, the powerhouse franchise it is today. It did so while also breaking new ground for the sci-fi shooter. Opting to ditch the more linear structure of previous Halo campaigns, Halo Infinite presents players with a semi-open world set on the broken but lush ring known as the Zeta Halo. It’s filled with Forerunner secrets, collectibles, Banished outposts, and so much more. When you’re not exploring Zeta Halo, you’ll likely find yourself enthralled with the story missions set throughout the ring. 

Featuring a more Halo: Combat Evolved-style of storytelling, if you’re a fan of the older games, something tells us you’re going to really enjoy what the Halo Infinite campaign has to offer. On top of that, Halo Infinite comes with a full multiplayer suite that’s entirely free-to-play, which means if you own an Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or a PC, you can jump in right now. Complete with a unique battle pass system, nearly a dozen maps, punchy weapons you know and love, and some of the series’ best combat to date, Halo Infinite’s multiplayer is sure to have you saying “just one more match.” Halo Infinite isn’t just a great game – it’s the best Halo’s been in years. | Our Review

            Forza Horizon 5

            Release: November 9, 2021

            From the moment Playground Games’ latest semi-arcade, semi-simulator racer begins, Forza Horizon 5 shines. Its opening is a thrilling adrenaline-inducing experience that doesn’t let up, and the same can be said for much of the game that follows. Forza Horizon 5’s Mexico is stunningly beautiful, teetering on the line of “is this real life” regardless of where you’re racing, be it the Baja desert, a tropical jungle, or a sun-soaked beach. Add in hundreds of cars realized digitally in the same life-like manner, and you’ve got a racer filled with dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of exciting gameplay. It’s a perfect showcase for the Xbox Series X/S generation of consoles, but it’s a fun time on Xbox One as well. | Our Review

            Hades

            Release: August 13, 2021

            Supergiant Games released Hades in 2018 as an early access title before it hit Xbox consoles this year, and you can tell Supergiant learned a lot during that time, as it shows in the final release. Today, Hades is a fantastic action game and one of the best titles available on Xbox. It charts new ground for the roguelite genre; proving games can tell meaningful narratives through the traditionally story-light format. It does so with a colorful cast of characters, great voice acting, a memorable score, and a beautiful art style that shines on Xbox consoles. If you’re looking for an enthralling romp through the hellish underworld or a game that’s easy to play in quick 20-minute bursts, you need to try Hades. | Our Review

            Yakuza: Like a Dragon

            Release: November 10, 2020

            Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's long-running Yakuza series bid a fond farewell to its protagonist Kiryu after seven mainline games. With Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the developer took a chance with Ichiban Kasuga, a loud, dorky, and well-intentioned protagonist that players immediately fell in love with. However, the changes didn't stop with the gold-hearted Kasuga. This also marked the series' transition to turn-based combat, which it transitioned to in seamless fashion. Despite these massive changes to the well-worn formula, Yakuza: Like a Dragon still feels decidedly at home when stacked alongside its predecessors thanks to the serious drama, the goofy side quests, and the nonstop action. | Our Review

            Release: November 10, 2020

            The 2D platformer genre isn't what it used to be, but that hasn't stopped Moon Studios from releasing some of the greatest entries in the illustrious genre's recent history. Ori and the Will of the Wisps took everything the first, beloved game did and made it better. With a fantastic story, a breathtakingly gorgeous world, and gameplay that allows you to run, jump, and fight through any challenge thrown your way, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an action-packed platformer that delivers on all fronts. | Our Review

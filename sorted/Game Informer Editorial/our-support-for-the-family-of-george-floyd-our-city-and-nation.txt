  Our Support For The Family Of George Floyd, Our City, And Nation






            As a Twin Cities company, Game Informer is devastated by the events of the last week. We are reeling from the gruesome and unjust death of George Floyd. We offer our condolences to the family and loved ones of George Floyd, and support to the countless other members of the Black community around the country whose pain and loss goes undocumented or unresolved. Â 

Gaming can often act as an escape from the troubles of real life, but for many families, there is no escape from persecution, harassment, and the threat of death. Systemic racism has no place in gaming or in our society.

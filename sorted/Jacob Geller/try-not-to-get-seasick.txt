Flotsam


  Try Not To Get Seasick




            The survival management subgenre generally isn't a cheery place. Recent sims like Frostpunk and This War of Mine drive that home, even with the most effective resource-gathering, some things are simply out of your control.

Flotsam, a new game from developer Pajama Llama, looks to be a lighter take on a still-dire situation. Set on a floating pile of trash, Flotsam tasks players with managing a floating village community as you recycle garbage into new structures, collect fish, and process drinkable water.

The game's colorful art style makes somewhat horrifying concepts – like fish wrapped in humanity's discarded trash – cuter than they have any right to be. 

Flotsam won't release until 2019, but the game aims to hit both PC and Mac.

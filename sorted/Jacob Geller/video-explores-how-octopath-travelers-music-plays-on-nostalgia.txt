  Video Explores How Octopath Traveler's Music Plays On Nostalgia 






            Octopath Traveler doesn't shy away from its inspirations. The turn-based combat, character classes, and pixel-art designs are all firmly rooted in classic JRPGS like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy. However, as evidenced by the many modern graphical filters layered on top of its pixels, the game plants one foot firmly in the present even while emulating the past. In our review, we said that it feels like "a game from an alternate timeline."

YouTube channel Game Score Fanfare tackles this apparent contradiction in a new video focusing on Octopath's orchestral soundtrack. Through a detailed analysis of how composers created themes for 16-bit JRPGs, the video demonstrates that simple melodies and specific instrumentation can evoke a powerful emotional response from the player.

EVE:Valkyrie


  Soaring To PSVR




EVE: Valkyrie is heading to PlayStation's virtual reality headset on October 13, and in preparation of its PSVR debut, a new launch trailer is out. The game was a launch title for the Oculus Rift and features the voice talents of Katee Sackoff of Battlestar Galactica fame.
On the Rift, the game has micro-transactions that allows players to purchase ship decals, skins, and cockpit interiors. It's unknown if these will carry over to the PSVR version at this time. Both versions have been promised free content for the lifetime of the game.
You can see the action-packed trailer below.

Cladun Returns: This Is Sengoku


  Dungeon Crawler Coming Stateside




The third installment of the Cladun series is getting localized by NIS America. This entry takes place during the Sengoku era, on a plane of existence between life and death. Ghosts of famous historical figures will need your help to achieve their final wishes so they can move on. 

Players will be able to customize their 8-bit characters down to the individual pixel and then share their creations with friends. Dungeons can be tackled in multiplayer either cooperatively or in a race for the most points.

This game is slated for release in Spring 2017.

  Interactive Map of the World of Dragon Age






Thedas is full of important locations with long histories. We only saw a handful of them in Dragon Age: Origins, and Dragon Age II will reveal even more about the continent's mysteries. If you want to know more about the significant places in the world (and maybe get some clues as to how they figure into Dragon Age II), check out our interactive map of Thedas.

Just click here (or the image below) to be taken to the map, where you can click on 10 key locations and find out where the fit into the past, present, and future of Dragon Age.

When you're done, you can use the link below to download your own high-res version of Thedas.

            Trapped in a haunted elementary school, players have to solve the mystery surrounding the gruesome fates of the dozens of children murdered there over the last years…and days. The trailer below is mostly text, and it's still creepy as hell.This PSP horror/adventure prides itself on its use of positional audio (given the player is wearing headphones, of course) to ratchet up the tension. Just as impressive is the fact that there are no traditional game over screens, only horrible endings to the story should you make bad choices.Corpse Party and its highly detailed 2D sprites and animation will be published exclusively as a PSP download via PlayStation Network this fall by Xseed Games.

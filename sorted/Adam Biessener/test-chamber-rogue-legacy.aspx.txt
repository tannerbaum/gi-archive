  Test Chamber â€“ Rogue Legacy






We take a look at the punishing indie platformer with the exceptional progression mechanics in this episode of Test Chamber.
Host Andrew Reiner is joined by Rogue Legacy reviewer Adam Biessener on the sticks, Tim Turi as backup joystick jockey in the event of catastrophic frustration, and general side-scrolling action aficionado Bryan Vore as color commentary. If we put our minds to it, we might just set a Test Chamber record for number of deaths in an episode.

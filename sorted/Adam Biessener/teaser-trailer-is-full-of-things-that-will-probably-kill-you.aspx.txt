Dark Souls


  Teaser Trailer Is Full Of Things That Will Probably Kill You




From Software's upcoming action/RPG Dark Souls is gearing up to kill you. In the game, I mean. What better way to prepare yourself than by watching this creepy teaser trailer?

Talking about games wanting to kill you reminds of the time a friend of mine was playing Diablo II, trying to level his first hardcore character online (where if you die, the character is deleted forever). He's having some trouble with the first boss, Andariel, so he joins a game called Kill Andy Now (the colloquial term for Andariel) on Battle.net looking for some help from his fellow adventurers.
Of course, he gets killed by a player 30 levels his senior as soon as he goes through the waypoint.
My friend's name? Andy. Obviously.
Remember: If it looks like something on the Internet is trolling you, it probably is.
Anyway, Dark Souls comes out on October 4 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Phil's Gamescom preview is your best bet to learn actual things about the game instead of looking at pretty videos in the meantime.

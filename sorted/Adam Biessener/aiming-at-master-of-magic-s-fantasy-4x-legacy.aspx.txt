Worlds of Magic, a Kickstarted indie game from tiny Polish studio Wastelands Interactive, is another self-described spiritual successor to Steve Barcia’s seminal Master of Magic. The twist: this one uses the popular d20 Open Gaming License popularized by 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons.

The alpha gameplay teaser above gives a decent idea of what to expect out of Worlds of Magic: Large fantasy worlds inhabited by powerful monsters and several distinct playable races, plus turn-based tactical combat featuring powerful spells, armored knights, and magical beings. 
Worlds of Magic is currently in early alpha and slated for release next year, though Wastelands promises a public demo soon. If you like what you see, vote for it on Steam Greenlight.

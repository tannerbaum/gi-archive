  Test Chamber – Scrolls






In this episode of Test Chamber, we're taking a look at Mojang's tactical card-battling game, Scrolls. 
As one of our interns, Brian Albert, quickly learns, Scrolls is nothing like Minecraft. We play through one match on easy mode and explain the game's goals, spells, and other turn-based nuances.
Brian never screws up. Not even once.

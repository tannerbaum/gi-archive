  Dungeon Crawl Old-School Style With Legend Of Grimrock

The indie PC RPG finally has a release date. You'll be able to delve the ancient tunnels of Mount Grimrock starting April 11 for just $14.99.
This is a dungeon crawl in the oldest style, a single-dungeon, minimal-story quest that features deadly traps, devious puzzles, and ugly monsters that challenges players to beat it rather than holding their hands through a 30-hour tutorial with a pretty cutscene at the end.
Though movement is on a grid just like in the antediluvian adventures that hooked me on gaming 25 years ago, the real-time combat that pits your party of four player-created heroes against the many foes of Mount Grimrock is a distinctly modern innovation – and the visuals look perfectly competent for 2012. 

I have to admit I'm tickled by the fact that Legend of Grimrock has an "old-school mode" that disables the automap so you can grid-paper it up. Reminds me of late nights being my brother's cartographer while he played through Might & Magic II on the Amiga at our dad's office.
Stay tuned for our review of Legend of Grimrock, which should be coming sooner than later. For now, you can see my initial impressions and the game's first-ever trailer here.

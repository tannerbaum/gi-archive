Sports games have mostly diverted from their arcadey roots in recent years. Old Time Hockey looks to harken back to the simplistic era of hockey games where controls weren't as complicated and the laws of physics were loosely followed.Â 
Up to four local players can jump into the (mostly) helmetless, afro-laden, and violent world of 1970s hockey in the Exhibition Mode. Old Time Hockey also has a narrative campaign where players can follow a blue-collared hockey team and help them win the championship.
Players can choose an old-school, two-button control mode or more modernized control scheme. Developer V7 Entertainment cites games like NHL 94, Blades of Steel, and 3-on-3 Open Ice as inspirations for Old Time Hockey's retro controls.
Old Time Hockey will come out on Xbox One, PC, and PS4 in early 2017.

  Rocksmith 2014 Edition Remastered Now Supports Acoustic Guitars






Ubisoft has figured out how to get your acoustic guitar to work in their guitar-focused rhythm game. Rocksmith 2014 Edition Remastered received a free update today on PS4, Xbox One, and PC today adding acoustic guitar compatibility. Plugging in a microphone to your PC or console will let you play the game with your newly-compatible acoustic guitar.
Ubisoft notes that the only real difference for acoustic guitars is that Authentic Tones is disabled but players will still be able to change the difficulty and see if they are hitting the right notes. Acoustic guitar players are also encouraged to mess around with the microphone settings since different mics can pick up the audio differently.
Disconnected Mode is also in this update, which just shows  the visual cues for the songs without the audio of your performance. For a more detailed list of the acoustic compatibility update, read the full rundown here.

Our TakeThis is a neat addition that sounds technically pretty challenging. Also more free compatibility that helps more people is always a good thing.

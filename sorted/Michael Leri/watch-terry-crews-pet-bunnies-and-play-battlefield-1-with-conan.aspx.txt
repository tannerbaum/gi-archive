  Watch Terry Crews Pet Bunnies And Play Battlefield 1 With Conan O'Brien






Battlefield 1 addresses the harsh realities of World War I and even host Conan O'Brien and actor Terry Crews have to take a break from the grim tone in the newest episode of Clueless Gamer. At least they know what to do this time, as opposed to Conan's last Clueless Gamer on Final Fantasy XV.
Crews is familiar with video games too, given that he's built a PC with his son and tested out the HTC Vive. Watch as he plays and Conan spectates and uses his wit to (once again) point out the many idiosyncrasies in video games.

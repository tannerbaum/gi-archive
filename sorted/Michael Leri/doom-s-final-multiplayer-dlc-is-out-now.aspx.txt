  Doom's Final Multiplayer DLC Is Out Now






While it's not as revered as the campaign for some, Doom's multiplayer is getting its last piece of paid DLC. Bloodfall, the third and final premium content pack, is out today on PS4, Xbox One, and PC for $14.99 and free for season pass owners. It contains three multiplayer maps,  a grenade launcher, hack modules, lateral foot thrusters, new taunts, and the ability to play as a Spectre Pinky.
The release of DLC kicks off a double experience "weekend" for the multiplayer from now until December 19 at 11pm CT.

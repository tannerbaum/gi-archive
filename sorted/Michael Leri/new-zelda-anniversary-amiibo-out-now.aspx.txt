  New Zelda Anniversary Amiibos Out Now, Functionality Revealed






Nintendo is celebrating The Legend of Zelda's 30th Anniversary by selling amiibos of 8-bit Link, Wind Waker Zelda, Toon Link, and Ocarina of Time Link. Each figure is available now and provides certain rewards in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when it arrives in 2017.
8-bit Link yields a random amount of barrels, Wind Waker Zelda gives a random selection of plants, Toon Link gifts the player a random amount of fish, and Ocarina of Time Link comes with a random amount of meat. Lucky players might even get a treasure chest with a rare item.
Breath of the Wild is coming out in 2017 but you can check out the latest trailer here and our hands-on impressions from E3 here.

Our TakeThe rewards are small but probably nice if you intend to get these amiibo anyway. Toon Link is my favorite but I'm still holding out for the amiibo of everyone's favorite Link.

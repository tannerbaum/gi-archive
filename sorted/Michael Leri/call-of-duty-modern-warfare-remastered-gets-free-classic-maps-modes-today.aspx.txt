  Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Gets Free Classic Maps And Modes Today






What is old is new again for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The remastered version of the most beloved Call of Duty received six throwback maps, two returning modes, and slew of new customization items for free today on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC. 
Modern Warfare Remastered now has all 16 maps from the original release, aside from the maps released in the Variety Map Pack, Call of Duty 4's multiplayer DLC from 2008. Hardpoint, the capture point objective mode, and Gun Game, the free-for-all mode where every kill earns you a new gun, are the two returning modes.
A holiday-themed version of the Crash map is  in the update as well and will give players special weapon camos if they complete challenges on that map. New customization items are also in the update, including weapon, reticles, uniforms, camos, emblems, calling cards, and the ability to play as a woman, a first for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

Our Take"Call of Duty" and "free maps" are rarely said in the same sentence so it's pretty great that these classic maps are finally being added to Modern Warfare for no charge.

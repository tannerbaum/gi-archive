  Blizzard Hints At Holiday-Themed Overwatch Event Next Week






Blizzard has invited players through Twitter to a seemingly winter-themed event slated to begin on December 13 in Overwatch. Through Blizzard's past holiday events and the snow-covered King's Row map in the tweet, this likely points to a winter holiday (and probably New Year's themed) event for Overwatch.
Although Blizzard has not confirmed anything, dataminers have dug up the leaked holiday theme music and what characters will likely get holiday-themed skins, emotes, and highlight intros (which have been accurate in the past).
It is also likely that this update will coincide with the reworked Symmetra from the Public Test Region, which we liked quite a bit.

Our TakeAs someone who loves Overwatch, I can't wait to dive back in and get some holiday loot boxes. I just hope I actually get some good holiday skins instead of coal.

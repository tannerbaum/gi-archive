  Orchestrated Ocarina Of Time Music Coming To Vinyl






Some of the nostalgic tones from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time will no longer be limited to the 3DS and Nintendo 64. A 64-piece orchestra is re-recording some of the music from Ocarina of Time and iam8bit is selling this updated music on a vinyl called Hero of Time, which is set to release in Q2 2017 for $40.

Pre-orders go live on December 9 at 10 a.m. PT on iam9bit's website. Materia Collective will also be distributing a digital version of the successfully Kickstarted and fan-made Hero of Time.

Eric Bucholz is arranging the one-hour album based on Koji Kondo's famous composition and illustrator and designer Ryan Brinkerhoff is doing the album art.

The Last Guardian


  Trico Comes To The Rescue In This CG Trailer




With each passing day, The Last Guardian's pending release becomes even more real. Today, Sony dropped a CG trailer for The Last Guardian along with a short Q&A; session with series creator Fumito Ueda.
While the trailer shows aspects we've seen before in demos, this CG trailer filters the gameplay through a more cinematic lens.
 Fumito Ueda also answered a few questions regarding the game and was fairly transparent. Most notably, he was honest about the executing on the vision of the game, but still feels confident in the final product.

“I’m going to be little hard on myself here… but to say I’ve done everything 100% is not completely true," he says. "As a creator, there’s always a little more you feel you could have done. When I finished Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, I felt exactly the same way. Having said that, I think the staff from Sony and Gendesign has put everything, every ounce of energy we had, and poured it into the project.”
Ueda goes on to discuss his thoughts on the comparisons to Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, the expansion of video games, his inspirations, and more in the Q&A; Sony conducted on the PlayStation Blog. 
The Last Guardian comes out on December 6 on PS4.

  Grab A Discounted PS4 Bundle For The Holidays






If you've been waiting to buy a cheaper PS4 during the gift-giving season, then Sony has you covered. Starting December 11 through December 24, you can buy a 500 GB PS4 Slim bundled with Uncharted 4: A Thief's End for $249.99 at participating retailers. Keep in mind that it includes a standard PS4 Slim and not a PS4 Pro.
This is just in time for Uncharted 4's free Survival Mode co-op update and a little before the upcoming standalone single-player chapter, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.

Capcom has been very secretive about Resident Evil 7. We've seen short teasers and demos, but nothing substantial from the game itself. We finally got a look at some of Resident Evil 7's mysteries when Capcom's Tim Turi came by Game Informer to give us a lengthy demo of their new horror game. 
In this segment of the Game Informer Show, watch as Ben Hanson, Tim Turi, Ben Reeves, and I share our thoughts on what we played from Resident Evil 7. Check out our written preview here.

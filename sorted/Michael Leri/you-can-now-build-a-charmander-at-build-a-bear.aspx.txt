  You Can Now Build A Charmander At Build-A-Bear






Build-A-Bear now has options for those of you who like fire lizards more than bears. Build-A-Bear's new pre-built Charmander stuffed animal costs $61 and comes with a Great Ball hoodie, Lucario hoodie, a "6-in1" sound chip, and an exclusive Pokémon trading card. Trainers wanting to build their own at physical stores have to wait until December 8.
The make-your-own version of Charmander will cost $28 and the Great Ball hoodie will go for $12.50, according to GameSpot. The Lucario hoodie and sound chip are exclusive to the online shop.
Charmander joins Pikachu and Eevee in the Pokémon section at Build-A-Bear. While Charmander isn't in Pokémon Sun or Moon, you can read our review of it here.

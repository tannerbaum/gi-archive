Bossa Studios is moving from gruesome, simulated surgery to exploring life as a piece of bread. The developer behind the infamous Surgeon Simulator, has announced that I Am Bread will be available via Steam Early Access this Wednesday, December 3. 
In a new trailer (below), you'll see the unassuming slice get into all kinds of interesting situations, like stealing pills from the bathroom or burning itself on a straightener. Of course you can always do normal bread stuff, like hop in the toaster, as well.

To learn more about the game, check out its Steam page. And if it's a different type of simulator you're looking for, might we suggest the first (and probably only) goat MMO?

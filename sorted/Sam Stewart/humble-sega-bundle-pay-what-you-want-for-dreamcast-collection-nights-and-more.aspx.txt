  Humble Sega Bundle: Pay What You Want For Dreamcast Collection, NiGHTS, And More






Today Humble announced it has teamed up with Sega for its latest deal, the Humble Sega Bundle. This latest offering lets you pay what you want for eight Sega games, including Sonic Adventure, NiGHTS Into Dreams, Crazy Taxi, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and more. As always, proceeds go to the developers and charity.
The four charities Humble is supporting with this bundle are AbleGamers, WIllow Foundation, SpecialEffect, and GamesAid. You can choose to donate equally to all four, or all to one if you like. 
 Beating the average donation will earn you even more games, and donating $50 gets you can exclusive Dreamcast t-shirt. The deal ends on Tuesday, December 9th so don't wait too long to decide if you want in. Also be sure to check the page frequently to see what games are added in the coming week.

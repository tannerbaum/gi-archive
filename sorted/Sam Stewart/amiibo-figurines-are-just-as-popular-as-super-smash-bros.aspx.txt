  Amiibo Figurines Are Just As Popular As Super Smash Bros.






Earlier this year Nintendo revealed Amiibos, collectible figurines with NFC chips in their bases that allow them to interact with a variety of Nintendo games. The figurines, which are obviously similar to games like Skylanders and Disney Infinity, raised some eyebrows. Does the game industry really need another set of figurines to collect? The answer, apparently, was a resounding yes, as Amiibos have gone on to sell at a surprising 1:1 ratio with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U since their launch.
According to Nintendo, the three best-selling figurines so far are Link, Mario, and Pikachu, in that order. The second run of Amiibos just launched, and a third run is already set for release early next year.
However, there are also rumors that certain, less popular figurines have already been discontinued, including Marth, Wii Fit Trainer, and Villager. Nintendo has yet to confirm these rumors, but eBay prices for those figures have already jumped to nearly $100.

Our TakeI loved the idea of Amiibo figures from the very beginning, even just as collectibles. I have yet to decide if their integration with the actual games is worth my time, but as far as cheap figurines of my favorite Nintendo characters go, it's gonna be hard to beat out Amiibos.

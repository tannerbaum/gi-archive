  Scarlet Moon Records Releases Final Fantasy Christmas EP 






If you've ever wondered why there aren't more remixes of Final Fantasy songs as Christmas tunes you can rest assured that you aren't the only one. Just in time for the holidays the folks over at Scarlet Moon Records (with the help of various composers) have put together a five track EP featuring remixes of various Final Fantasy songs, one track from Saturday Morning RPG, and a bonus track from Dragon Fantasy Book II composer Dale North.
Other composers include Scarlet Moon Productions' Jayson Napolitano, Goomin Nam of the DJMAX series, and Vince DiCola who worked on 1986's Transformers: The Movie. The Final Fantasy games featured on the EP include Final Fantasy XI, VIII, and IV.Â 
The album is available right now via Loudr for $5. You can also check out Scarlet Moon's other releases, featuring a variety of other game music, at their website.

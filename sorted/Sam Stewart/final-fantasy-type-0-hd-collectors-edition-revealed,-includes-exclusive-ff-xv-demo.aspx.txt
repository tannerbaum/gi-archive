  Final Fantasy Type-0 HD Collector's Edition Revealed, Includes FF XV Demo






Last night Square-Enix announced that Final Fantasy Type-0 HD would be getting a Collector's Edition, available in very limited quantities. The Collector's Edition, which is available for pre-order on both Xbox One and PlayStation 4, costs $99.99 and comes with a steelbook case, 200-page manga, 80-page artbook, soundtrack, and replica's of cards used by the character Ace. Your pre-order will also guarantee you day-one access to the Final Fantasy XV Episode Duscae Demo.
That demo is not exclusive to the Collector's Edition, but to anyone who buys a day-one edition of the game. Subsequent printings of the title will not include the demo, and it won't be available for download anywhere else. Your pre-order will also enter you for a chance at winning a Type-0 custom PS4, an art canvas of the main character, a lapel pin, and many other prizes. 
The Collector's Edition is available for pre-order right now through Square-Enix's site, and the game will officially launch in North America on March 15, 2015.

Our TakeI really love buying collector's editions, especially ones that come with steel book cases. While I'm not particularly interested in Type-0 myself, this seems like an awesome package for any die-hard Final Fantasy fan.

  Alien: Isolation's Second DLC, Trauma, Is Out Today






Sega and Creative Assembly have announced that the second add-on pack for Alien: Isolation is available today. The DLC pack, titled Trauma, puts you in control of Dr. Lingard, Sevastopol's medical officer. To give fans an idea of what to expect, Creative Assembly has also put together a developer Let's Play which you can see below.
The new maps in Trauma are titled Reoperation, Crawl Space, and Overrun. Players have to quickly destroy Dr. Lingard's research to ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Each map has its own leaderboard, challenging players to improve their times and fight for the top spot.

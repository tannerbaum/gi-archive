  Free Trials Fusion Update Adds Teams Feature, Online Multiplayer Coming Early 2015






Today RedLynx released a free update for all versions of Trials Fusion adding the feature to create Teams. Groups of racers can combine their progress and work their way up a global leaderboard and compete against other Teams. Teams can create their own name and emblem to represent them online, and each team will have their own leaderboard to help them communicate.
Teams will also be able to compete against each other in multiplayer races once the online multiplayer update for the game goes live in early 2015. This mode will allow 4-player races on Xbox 360, and 8-player races on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You will be able to race against random players online or with friends in private games. 
Anyone who purchased the game on PC has a chance to get an invite to the online multiplayer beta which launched today alongside the teams update. RedLynx will also be giving out codes through their TrialsLive site as well as social media. Check out their site for all the details. 

Our TakeI love the Trials games and bought the season pass version of Trials Fusion so I'm happy to hear that RedLynx is continuing to support this game, and with free dlc no less! I don't know if I will ever make use of the teams feature, but I think racing my friends online rather than their ghosts will be fun.

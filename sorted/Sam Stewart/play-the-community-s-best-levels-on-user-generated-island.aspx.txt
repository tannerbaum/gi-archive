Developer Free Lives has announced a custom content-focused island coming to its game Broforce. The new area, named User-Generated island, will be filled with the best user created levels. To encourage more creation, Free Lives are also holding bi-monthly level design contests - known as The Weekend Workshop Brodown.
“The Free Lives team has been incredibly impressed with the creativity and craftsmanship in the custom levels created by the community over the past few months,” says Artist Jarred Lunt via the press release. “There were suspicions that our own Broforce level designers were grossly incompetent and obsolete but this new initiative confirms it.”

Broforce is still in Steam Early-Access, where you can buy it right now for $14.99. To learn more about the game check out our preview from a few months back.

Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that Dead or Alive 5 Last Round will be coming to PC via Steam alongside the console versions. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the entire game will be arriving on the February 17, 2015 launch date.
In the information section of the Steam product page, the publisher says that the online modes will arrive in a patch, which could take up to three months. Despite that, Koei Tecmo has released a new trailer showing off the updated graphics and the new costumes you can get in the game.

The costume packs will be available as preorder bonuses from GameStop, Amazon, and Best Buy. The game will have over 300 costume, hair, and accessory options, allowing for near endless customization. A new character was also teased in the trailer, and her identity will be announced on January 15th.

Koei Tecmo promises Last Round will be the most graphically impressive Dead or Alive game yet, with fluid animations and dynamic locations. You can read our review of the original game here. Dead or Alive 5 Last Round is available for preorder on Steam right now for $39.99.

  Bungie Drops The Banhammer On Players Using Modded Consoles






If you are a console modder who has been considering giving Destiny a go, you might want to think again. Bungie has revealed that a number of Destiny players have been banned for playing the game on modded consoles. Though the report didn't specify what exactly these players were hoping to achieve through modding, it does ensure they will continue to drop the banhammer on anyone who dares play on a modded machine. 
"We routinely review Banhammer actions to ensure that they are applied accurately and fairly. A review of the bans applied over the last week shows that all of the affected accounts had logged into Destiny on a modified console at some point."
Bungie attributed its above quote to "The shadowy forces who protect the world of Destiny from shadowy activities," and while the developer is having a bit of fun with the announcement, the bans are the real deal. Bungie also assures players that as long as you play on the "boxes that your favorite retailer 'gave' you," you're gonna be just fine.

Our TakeWhile it should come as no surprise that Bungie is actively pursuing and banning players using modded consoles, it's welcome news nonetheless; given Destiny's mixed reception, it's good to know Bungie is doing everything in its power to ensure the multiplayer-focused experience isn't compromised by players using modified equipment.

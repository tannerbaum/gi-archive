Civilization VI


  Sphinxes And Chariots Galore In New Trailer For Egyptian Leader Cleopatra 




Famous Egyptian Pharaoh Cleopatra VII is making her return to the Civilization series. Under her rule, you can build up your own empire in the cradle of civilization and create allies as the true Cleopatra did through her romances with influential Roman figures Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Check out the resources at her disposal in a new trailer.   
Sid Meier’s Civilization VI boasts some big changes to core gameplay, including some new features specific to Egypt. The Maryannu Chariot Archer is a new unique unit, which has a larger base for more ammunition, but horses and chariots may face maintenance complications when they venture out onto more lengthy battles. Players can also build the famous monumental sculpture, the Sphinx, which improve faith and culture and get certain bonuses when built beside a wonder. Leaders are said to have certain obsessions and demands when it comes to the building of their empires, and it seems Cleopatra wants as many wonders as she can get into her realm.

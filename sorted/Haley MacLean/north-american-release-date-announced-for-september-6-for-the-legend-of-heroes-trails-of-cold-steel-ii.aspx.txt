The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II


  North American Release Date Is September 6




XSEED revealed an official North American release date for The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II. The RPG will be arriving on western shores on September 6. 
The game will be available on both PlayStation 3 and Vita. It's priced at $39.99 and will be available later in the Fall for European players. It originally released in Japan in 2014. 
Cross-save functionality between both available platforms will be supported, with save data from the original title The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel offering special in-game bonus stats and extra items. The sequel takes place one month after the conclusion of the first and utilizes the same turn-based combat as its predecessor. 
The third game in the series, Trails in the Sky The Third has been announced for a 2017 western release as well, but we have no details on specifically when or what platforms it will be hosted on.

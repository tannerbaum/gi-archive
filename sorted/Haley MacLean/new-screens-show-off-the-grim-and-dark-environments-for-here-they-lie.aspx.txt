Here They Lie


  New Screens Show Off The Grim And Dark Environments




A trailer was released during E3 showcasing new horror-survival game Here They Lie from Sony and independent studio The Tangentlemen. 
The game will be available for both PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4. Several possible enemies were featured in the trailer, including an antlered humanoid figure and several humans wearing animal masks. The goal of the game is said to be maintaining survival while you try and uncover the mystery of "the woman in yellow."

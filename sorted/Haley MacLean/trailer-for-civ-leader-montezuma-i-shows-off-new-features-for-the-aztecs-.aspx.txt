Civilization VI


  Trailer For Civ Leader Montezuma I Shows Off New Features For The Aztecs




Montezuma I, the ruler of the Aztec Triple Alliance and second Emperor to the empire, is coming to Sid Meier's Civilization VI as the head for the Aztec people. Along with his leadership, the Aztec pack includes a wealth of new features. 
Following in the footsteps of Cleopatra of Egypt, Queen Victoria of England, and President Roosevelt for America, the announcement of Montezuma I's inclusion in the game came with a trailer and explanation of the new features surrounding the Aztec people. The Aztecs unique unit is called the eagle warriors, which historically were one of the two infantry classes in the empire along with the jaguar warriors. These fighters are a stronger version of the basic warrior unit and come with the special ability of turning defeated enemies into building units, allowing you to build up your Aztec civilization all the faster.

There is also a unique building, the Tlachtli, which is a sports arena where players attempt to get a ball into a stone hoop without using their hands. Think of that armadillo scene from The Road to El Dorado. This building in the entertainment complex give amenities, faith, and great general points. 
The Aztec pack also comes with the Huey Teocalli as its wonder, a special ability allowing builders to speed up the construction of districts, and another ability for Montezuma I that makes amenities more valuable. Starting today, those who pre-order Sid Meier's Civilization VI will gain early access to the Aztec civ when the game launches on PC on October 21. After 90 days the content will be unlocked to all other players at no additional charge.

  Asymmetrical Multiplayers To Play On Your Day Off






            It’s Memorial Day, and to celebrate the long weekend, we’re shining the spotlight on the asymmetrical multiplayer genre. This category features games where two groups face each other, but each side has unique, sometimes wildly disproportionate, skills and goals. As evidenced by many of the year’s recently released and upcoming titles, like Evil Dead: The Game, IllFonic’s Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleased, and Dragon Ball: The Breakers, the genre is seeing a resurgence. There’s no shortage of asymmetrical games you can jump into right now if you want to hone your skills or build up anticipation for soon-to-be-released titles.

            Dead by Daylight

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, PC, iOS, Android

            It’s hard to talk asymmetrical multiplayer without Dead by Daylight. Released nearly six years ago, the game is still a genre favorite and is on its 23rd chapter. Players split into two teams; one consists of a Killer, and the other, four Survivors. The characters on both sides are inspired by pop culture, including a few you might have seen in our Evil Dead: The Game cover story.

            Among Us

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, Android

            Social deception games recently garnered interest due to the unexpected popularity of one title: Among Us. The game sets up a struggle between a spaceship’s unsuspecting Crewmates and predatory alien Imposters. To win, the Crewmates must identify each would-be murderer and eject them into the cold vastness of space before the Imposters can cut all the innocent astronauts down.

            Back 4 Blood

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

            As a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead created by original developer Turtle Rock Studios, Back 4 Blood’s Versus Mode channels its forbearer. The recent mode lacks some of the old spark and doesn’t include a campaign component, but you still get to play as Ridden.

            Predator: Hunting Grounds

            PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC

            Become the titular threat from the Predator movies and hunt your friends down one by one. The four-player human team is ready for war with a pack of weapons, but they must contend with the alien’s arsenal, which includes heat-sensing vision and cloaking abilities. 

            Resident Evil Resistance

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

            You and three friends can join the Resistance in Resident Evils 3’s online multiplayer mode. Get through all three stages set before you by the fifth member of the group, who plays the role of a faceless Umbrella Corporation Mastermind – made harder by the ever-present risk of zombies.

            Secret Neighbor

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, PC

            In this multiplayer take on the popular Hello Neighbor games, you and your teammates break into the suspicious house next door, trying to rescue a friend from its locked basement. However, one of your companions is the Neighbor in disguise, intent on trapping you in the home forever.

            Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege

            PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

            The number of teammates begins the same at the start of a 5v5 Rainbow Six Siege match, but that inevitably changes as each operator mercilessly uses their unique abilities to eliminate their opponents. The result is a unique and intense asymmetrical struggle.

            Intruder

            PC

            Intruder is still in Early Access, but the five-on-five, spy-vs-guards title is fully playable. Inspired by Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, Intruder is all about stealth, with one faction using every available stratagem and gadget to get past their fellow players, the guards.

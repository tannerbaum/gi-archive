  Crytek Reveals New Map For Hunt: Showdown In Creepy Trailer






Crytek revealed a second map, the Lawson Delta, for Hunt: Showdown in a nightmarish trailer. In 1861, the Civil War blew through Lawson but the evil never left. Mimicking late 19th century slideshow technology to creepy effect, Crytek presents how citizens of the idyllic town fell on hard times during the war, and then rose again as an undead horde. We know the Lawson Delta map is set in post-Civil War Louisiana, but more details will be revealed at TwitchCon, running from October 26-28 in San Jose, California.

Hunt: Showdown is a multiplayer bounty hunting game from Crytek that takes you to “the darkest corners of the world” which released on Steam Early Access in February. The competitive first-person shooter mixes survival and match-based gameplay together with PvP and PvE elements. Play solo or in groups of two to track down gruesome monsters in the swamps of Louisiana, but, with up to ten players in a match all hoping to bag the same trophies, watch out that the hunter doesn’t become the hunted.

Players can experience the Lawson Delta map in person exclusively at Hunt: Showdown’s TwitchCon booth before it goes live shortly after the event. Hunt: Showdown is currently available on Steam Early Access. For a look at gameplay, check out a round for New Gameplay Today back in February.

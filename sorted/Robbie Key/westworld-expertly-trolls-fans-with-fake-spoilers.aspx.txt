  Westworld Expertly Trolls Fans With Fake Spoilers






One of the many facets Westworld's first season excelled at was subtly taking popular songs and turning them into saloon-style piano tunes. HBO has carried over that quality to a trolling video that was said to be spoiler-heavy.
Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy initially said they were out to save season two spoilers by, well, spoiling events after an inquiry on Reddit. The 25-minute video starts out as a seemingly legitimate spoiler-filled reel as Bernard wakes up on a beach with no memories and hazy flashbacks. As Bernard experiences total recall and winds up in the main town of the first season, he comes upon Dolores and Clementine (Rachel Evan Wood and Angela Sarafyan, respectively) playing and singing a somber piano version of Rick Astley's infamous "Never Gonna Give You Up" song.
After the song ends about a minute later, a message reads, "Dear Reddit, from all of us here at Westworld, thank you for watching. We hope you enjoy season two..." The remaining 22 minutes of the video show a dog sitting on the chair of the same piano with the show's score playing and a black and white filter.

Westworld's sophomore season premiers at 9:25 p.m. April 21 on HBO. Until then, check out our preview of the Westworld mobile game and the season two trailer that gives a glimpse of the shogun world.

  Galactic Civilizations III Launches Latest Expansion And Update






Stardock Entertainment's Galactic Civilizations III launches its Intrigue expansion and 3.0 update today.
Intrigue boasts several new elements to running space societies. Features include forming a government based on tech and alien races, creating an independent colony, galaxy-wide trade market, and special event tracking. The 3.0 update comes with a tutorial mode, taxation, and farming. The Intrigue expansion costs $19.99, while the 3.0 update is free to all players.
To celebrate the new content, Stardock is discounting the game to $13.59 on its website and Steam until tomorrow. The game's gold edition, which comes with the soundtrack and all previous content excluding the Intrigue expansion, will also be on sale for $46.99.

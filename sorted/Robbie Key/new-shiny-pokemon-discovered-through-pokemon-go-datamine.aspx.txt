  New Shiny Pokémon Discovered Through Pokémon Go Datamine






Dataminer Chrales has discovered that many more shiny Pokémon are coming to Pokémon Go.
The data, which Chrales frequently dabbles in for Pokémon Go, reveals players will have a chance to catch shiny iterations for any of the first two generations of pocket monsters – or numbers 1 through 251. Chrales first showed the shinies in a Twitch stream. Although the stream is not on his Twitch channel, the events are greatly detailed on a fan site, Pokémon Go Hub.
Chrales and LeekDuck, a user who specializes in Pokémon Go updates, also uploaded graphics on Imgur showing which shinies he mined from the data. Note that this does not mean the shinies are not currently available to catch, nor has developer Niantic stated when they will go live.

Here's a look at all the Shinies added today from Johto (Generation 2). Special Thanks to @Chrales. Although these were found in the network traffic, it does not mean they are coming to the game soon. pic.twitter.com/1tESTuc7T5

Shiny Pokémon first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver. According to Bulbapedia, the recent X/Y and Sun/Moon give players a 1/4096 chance (or 0.00024 percent) of catching a shiny version. In previous generations, those chances were halved. So far, only a few Pokémon, like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Swablu, have had shiny versions appear in Pokémon Go.

Our TakeYou had my curiosity at shiny Umbreon and Espeon, but with the entire first two generations, you have my attention. This could be a high motivator for nostalgia-fueled '90s kids to jump back in.

  Gecco Shows Unfinished Prototype For Gray Fox Statue






Japanese Toy and figure manufacturer Gecco Corp. has unveiled an undeveloped Gray Fox statue at Wonder Festival Shanghai 2018.
This finely detailed statue of Metal Gear Solid's Cyborg Ninja, which can be seen from different angles on Gecco's Facebook page, is at a 1/6 scale. If math and Gray Fox's 185-centimeter height on the Metal Gear wiki are anything to go by, the statue is between 11 to 12 inches. It also comes with an interchangeable sword, gun arm, and helmet that shows his face. 
Details on the cost, release date, and if it will ship outside Japan have not been shared.

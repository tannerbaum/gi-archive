  Rabbid Peach Shows Beyoncé Swagger In Just Dance Trailer






If you needed one more reason to get Just Dance 2018 on Switch, perhaps this trailer featuring Rabbid Peach dancing to Beyoncé's "Naughty Girl" will push you into the Rabbid-filled abyss.
Set in front of Peach's Castle from Mario + Rabbids with back-up dancing Rabbids in tow, Rabbid Peach mimics dances akin to Beyoncé's music videos. This alternate version of "Naughty Girl" is exclusive to the Switch and only available through Just Dance Unlimited, the franchise's on-demand service.

Maybe this addition is why Ubisoft formed the New Mumbai and Odessa studios last month.

Our TakeShould I feel guilty for genuinely finding this funny? I should feel guilty for genuinely finding this funny, but that's probably because I adore Mario + Rabbids.

  Report: Top-Secret 2K Studio Working On New BioShock






A new report reveals a secret studio from publisher 2K is working on a new entry in the acclaimed BioShock series.
Kotaku news editor Jason Schreier in a feature titled "How The Makers of Mafia III Lost Their Way" researched developer Hangar 13's changes in the past year and a half. Top members, ranging from Mafia III's senior producers to design leads and its art director, were laid off in February or moved on to different avenues in the industry. Others, however, "moved to the top-secret studio next door to work on an unannounced new BioShock game," Schreier reports. He also says in a tweet that it's a 2K studio behind the project.

Among other details I learned while reporting this story: Right next to Hangar 13, a top-secret 2K studio is now working on a top-secret new BioShock game.

Our TakeIt will feel strange knowing the keys to the BioShock kingdom are in the hands of someone who isn't Ken Levine, but 2K has fared well in the past. BioShock 2 is a solid game, and Minerva's Den is nothing short of excellence in story content.

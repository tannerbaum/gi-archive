  Nicki Minaj Releasing Street Fighter-Inspired Track Tomorrow






We all think Nicki Minaj when we hear or see Street Fighter, right? At least that's probably what the songwriters envision for Minaj's upcoming single titled "Chun-Li."
Minaj announced on her Twitter account that "Chun-Li" will release "everywhere" at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on April 12. The tweet also boasts a picture with Minaj sporting hair buns akin to the famous female fighter, as well as a jaguar-like pattern top and thong. You know, just like Chun-Li does.

Minaj tweeted about it today with a picture of her with Chun-Li hair (and no pants on, so don't click if you're at work) right here.

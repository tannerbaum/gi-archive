  Shenmue I And II Coming To Console And PC






Sega has announced that versions of the first two Shenmue games are coming physically and digitally to Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.
Both games still retain their Dreamcast aesthetics but with higher resolutions, improved textures, graphical options on PC, and an updated user interface. Players can also choose between modern and classic control settings, as well as English or Japanese dubs. The physical and digital releases are priced at $29.99.
Regarding a Switch release, Sega says, "We are focusing on the console and PC versions only right now," meaning there's a possibility it could come to the Nintendo platform.

There hasn't been much recent news from Shenmue III. Fortunately, character's faces will in fact move after the game's first teaser trailer received criticism for its lack of facial animations. We also know Deep Silver is set to publish the title. Shenmue III currently has a release window slated for the second half of this year.

Our TakeAs someone who was a Nintendo fanboy as a kid and missed out on anything under the Sega sun, I'm looking forward to diving into these open-world games to see how much influence has seeped into gaming over the years. Hopefully, this announcement also means we will get a more concrete date on Shenmue III's release.

  The Latest Great Books From Marvel And DC, The Batman, Hulk, And More | From Panel To Podcast






            This episode is jam-packed with reviews of comic books you should be reading, including The Hulk, Catwoman, and even a new Buffy the Vampire Slayer story that we didn't expect to see. We also spend a fair amount of the episode looking ahead to this week's releases. This could be one of the biggest comic book days we've ever seen and should make for a hell of an episode next week. If you want to know what we are getting, listen to the back half of the show.

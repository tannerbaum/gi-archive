            Horizon: Zero Dawn's Aloy is now a part of Genshin Impact. She was added to the game yesterday and is free to all players on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

To add her to your party, you first need to raise your Adventure rank to 20. Once you do this, open the mail in game, and you'll be able to claim Aloy and her predator bow. After rebooting the game on PlayStation 4 or 5, she'll be waiting for you on the character select screen. If you are NOT Adventure rank 20, Aloy will be added to the PlayStation 4 and 5 versions for lower rank players on October 12 as a part of Genshin Impact's 2.2 update.

For those of you playing Genshin Impact on PC or mobile, Aloy will eventually make her way to these devices. That will happen on November 23 with the 2.3 update. Until that day she will remain a PlayStation exclusive. However, your PlayStation saves carry over to other devices, so if you unlock her on your PlayStation 5, you can continue your journey with her on mobile or PC.

When Aloy is in your party, animals that produce raw, fowl, or chilled meat will not be startled by your movements. Her bow is as lethal as you would hope, and can be fired quickly at any range. You can also hold a shot longer for precision, which is great for sniping opportunities. Bringing in an element of the Frozen Wilds she once roamed, her arrows can be equipped with frost damage, and she can throw freeze bombs that explode on impact. Both of these attacks deal cryo damage.

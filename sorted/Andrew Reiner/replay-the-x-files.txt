  Replay – The X-Files






            Set roughly during the third season of The X-Files show, the 1998 PlayStation game of the same name follows FBI agent Craig Willmore as he tries to track down Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. This point-and-click adventure uses a full-motion-video technology called Virtual Cinema, which offers up a number of choices called ... wait for it ... UberVariables.

The Game Informer crew is playing through the opening moments of this forgotten gem and will do their best to not butcher X-Files legacy in the process. Enjoy the episode, and we'll see you again live in seven days!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

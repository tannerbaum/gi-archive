  Updated: All Of The Marvel And DC Superheroes In Fortnite






            From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan's dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there's a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics. Epic surprisingly didn't create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.

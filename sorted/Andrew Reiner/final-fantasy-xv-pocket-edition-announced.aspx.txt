Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition


  Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition Announced




A large section of Square Enix's Gamescom booth is dedicated to Final Fantasy XV. In this area, people at the show can get their hands on Final Fantasy XV's new "Comrades" multiplayer mode, catch lunkers in the PlayStation VR game Monsters of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV, and get a brief taste of Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition, which supports native 4K and 8K resolutions. Square Enix today announced more Final Fantasy XV is on the way, and you'll be able to carry it with you wherever you go.
Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition is a remake of the console game, coming soon to iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices. The most noticeable difference is the new chibi-style graphics, but the story will also unfold in a different way across 10 episodes, the first of which is free. All of the episodes will be available on day one, but it sounds like you'll need to buy them to continue your journey. Like almost every phone game ever made, this version features touch controls.

  Justice League, Thor, Batman, And The Biggest Week Ever For Comics? | From Panel To Podcast 






            Want to know what I thought of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Moon Knight? I weigh in on both of these Marvel Cinematic Universe juggernauts, and we also talk about a comic book that should be turned into a game because it reads and looks like one. This episode is jam-packed with reviews of comic books you should be reading, including Batman, Twig, Flashpoint Beyond, and more. We also discuss the new comic books that will be on store shelves shortly.

From Panel to Podcast is a weekly show created by two lifelong comic book readers who offer suggestions on which comic books you should be reading each week. Each episode also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We'll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.

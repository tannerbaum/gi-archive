  Replay – The Legend Of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures






            Watch the Game Informer staff become best friends in this four-player classic. Released for the GameCube on June 7, 2004, The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures can be played by one to four-players, and is at its best when four Game Boy Advances are used. That's right, you are asked to use a Game Boy Advance instead of the GameCube controller. Why? Because the Game Boy Advance screen is used for some dungeon exploration, as some players may still be above ground.

We play through the opening act of this fascinating gaming relic, and sadly didn't find a great way to show you what we are seeing when we go into underground spaces. You'll just have to take our word that it works well and everything we see is super cool.

Thanks again for watching! We'll be back in seven days with another episode!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

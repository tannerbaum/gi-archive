  Avowed Is The Next RPG From Obsidian Entertainment






            Microsoft acquired Obsidian Entertainment in 2018, and the studio has been pumping out games since. Along with The Outer Worlds and Grounded, Obsidian is also working on a new first-person RPG called Avowed.

While only shown briefly at today's Xbox Games Showcase, Avowed looks stunning, and invites players into the world of Eora, which just happens to be filled with magic, warring factions, and skeletal warriors. Most of the trailer above is cinematic, but we do get a look at what the game will look like through the eyes of a character who is wielding a sword in his right hand and some kind of magic in his left.

If you are thinking Avowed looks like The Elder Scrolls, you are not alone. No release date was given at this time, but it is coming to Xbox Series X.

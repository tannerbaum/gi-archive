  Scarlet Witch Joins Fortnite: All Of The Marvel And DC Superheroes In The Game






            From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan's dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there's a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is Scarlet Witch from the new film Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.

She comes hot on the heels of Moon Knight, who is modeled after the Disney+ series. You can select whether you'll play as Marc Spector (Moon Knight) or Steven Grant (Mr. Knight). The Spector version can be played with the cape on or off.

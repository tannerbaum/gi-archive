  Replay – Silent Hill: Downpour






            Watch the Game Informer crew explore a spooky town filled with lots of fog and maybe a few dogs in this look back at Konami's classic horror series. Silent Hill: Downpour is the eighth game in this highly adored franchise and was developed by Vatra Games, a studio that only made two games: this one and the miserable Rush'n Attack: Ex-Patriot. Downpour received a decent 7 out of 10 rating from Game Informer, and we'll see how well that rating and the game hold up today.

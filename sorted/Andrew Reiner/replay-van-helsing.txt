  Replay – Van Helsing






            Join the Game Informer crew on a journey through the video game adaptation of the feature film Van Helsing. Hugh Jackman reprises his role of Gabriel Van Helsing, and we get to see how he deals with demons and Mr. Hyde. The game was developed by Saffire Corporation and published by Vivendi Universal Games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox on May 6, 2004.

We play through the opening moments of this title, which appears to be heavily inspired by Devil May Cry, but lacks its depth in movesets and enemies. Since we grow bored of Van Helsing's repetitive action within minutes, we ended playing three games this episode. Game two is Without Warning from Capcom, and game three is Split/Second from Disney.

We hope you enjoy the episode, and we'll see you again in seven short days!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

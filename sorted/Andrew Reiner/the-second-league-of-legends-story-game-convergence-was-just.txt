  The Second League Of Legends Story Game, Convergence, Was Just Revealed






            In the span of one night, two new League of Legends games were announced. At the beginning of the Game Awards, Airship Syndicate announced Ruined King, the first League of Legends Story game, and then roughly an hour later, Double Stallion revealed Convergence, the second League of Legends Story game.

In Convergence, players play as Echo through single-player action/platforming stages. Echo is a young inventor who has created a device that can manipulate time. The story will explore what goes wrong when you mess around with time. No other details were shared.

  Batman, Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Wonder Woman, And More! | From Panel To Podcast






            On this week's episode we dive into our first listener read-along for Spider-Man: Kraven's Last Hunt, a six-issue story from 1987 that couldn't have been much darker. We also share our thoughts on last week's books, including Moon Knight, Devil's Reign, Little Monters, X-Men: Red, and more.

As always, the episode ends with a look ahead to this week's releases.

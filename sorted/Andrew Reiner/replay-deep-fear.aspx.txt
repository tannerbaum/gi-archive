  Replay – Deep Fear






The countdown to Game Informer's annual December 31 Super Replay is under way, and we're actively searching for the best candidate for this esteemed honor. We'd like to introduce you, the Replay viewers, to help us hone in on the worst best game for this Super Replay.
We're intrigued by Escape From Bug Island, and today's Replay game, Deep Fear, a survival-horror game for Sega Saturn. Deep Fear never released stateside, so we decided to take a look at a Japanese import. Don't worry, all of the audio is in English, and we do our damned best to not speak over any cutscenes. We immediately fell in love with the high production values and wonderful cast of characters. We didn't want our time with Deep Fear to end. Is it a good candidate for the December 31 Super Replay? Let us know in the comments below. 
We then introduce a new segment at the episode's break, perhaps showing how video game characters would treat the player if their dialogue wasn't scripted. The final segment of this episode takes us back to Replay: Season 3's beginnings, putting Kyle Hilliard's listening skills to the test.
Thanks again for watching, and let us know if you stumble upon any candidates for the December 31 Super Replay. There's plenty of time between now and the end of the year to take a look at as many bad games as we can!

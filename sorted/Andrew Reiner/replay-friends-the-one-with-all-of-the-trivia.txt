  Replay – Friends: The One With All Of The Trivia






            We already took a look at Friends: The One With All of the Trivia on a previous episode of Replay, but felt a strong desire to revisit it this week. The game was released for PlayStation 2 and PC in 2005, and features over 3,000 questions, 700 clips from the show, and is hosted by the show's Janice and Gunther.

It's one of those games that made us say "this can't be real" when it was announced back in the day, and continues to hurt our brains when we think about it existing today. Enjoy the episode, everyone. We'll be back with another live episode in just seven days! Thanks again for the support!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

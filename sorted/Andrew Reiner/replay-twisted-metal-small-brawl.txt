  Replay – Twisted Metal: Small Brawl






            This is the final episode of Replay: Season Five! This is also the final episode of Replay: Phase One! Come next week, this silly, little show will be dramatically different ... and hopefully for the better. We decided to return to the first series we ever featured in an episode of Replay to bookmark this format of the show. It's bittersweet send off, but we couldn't be more excited for what comes next.

This episode is much shorter than others, and we needed to cut it off to focus on what we're ushering in. If you are curious what that may be, watch the episode. We walk through our plans extensively, and also have a good discuss about Twisted Metal: Small Brawl in the process. Small Brawl released on November 26, 2001 for PlayStation and was developed by Incognito Entertainment. Kyle of course picks a van, but is is one series where he can be forgiven for doing that.

Enjoy the episode, and we'll see you in seven days with Replay: Phase Two!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  New Gameplay Today – Rage 2






            In this episode of New Gameplay Today, we dive into Avalanche Studios and id Software's open-world shooter a day before release, and show off a couple of missions as we freely explore the wasteland in a tricked-out vehicle. Rage 2 takes place 30 years after the original game, and puts players into the military boots of a character named Walker, who just happens to be the last of the Rangers of the Vineland, a faction that uses Nanotrites to get an edge in combat and obtain Force-like senses.

Game Informer's Dan Tack gave Rage 2 a 7 out of 10, saying that "for all of its attempts at garish glitter, Rage 2 is a muted, clichéd, and uninspiring experience propped up by spectacular shooting and neverending battles that sometimes live up to the promise of a carnival of carnage." Although I've only just started playing, I appear to like it a bit more than Dan, but he says that a lack of variety ends up being a killer that pulls the fun down.

Enjoy the video, which features commentary by Dan, Javy Gwaltney, and Ben Hanson. Just know that you'll have to tolerate watching me on the sticks.

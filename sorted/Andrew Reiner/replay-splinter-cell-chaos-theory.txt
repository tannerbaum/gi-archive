  Replay – Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory






            On this week's show we take a look at Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, the third entry in the beloved stealth/action series. We go in without any tutorial, which proves to be costly early on, but once we learn how to see in the dark and punch guys in the ears, things turn around and we make progress for the first time in Replay history. We dedicate the full hour to this classic title that appeared on pretty much every system at the time, including PlayStation 2 and GameCube.

Thanks again for watching. This week's show was prerecorded, but we'll hopefully be back to the live format next week for another viewer-choice pick.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Replay – Spyro: A Hero's Tail






            Spyro the Dragon is a beloved character who has far too many skeletons in his closet. Following Insomniac Games' brilliant trilogy of games, the purple dragon fell on dark times, bouncing from one development house to the next, none capable of delivering the magic fans have come to expect. Spyro: A Hero's Tail is one of those failed ventures. It looks like Spyro and plays like Spyro, but the heart and soul of the adventure is missing. The flow isn't right.

A Hero's Tail is Spyro's fifth console game and was developed by Eurocom Entertainment. It released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube on November 9, 2004. We take a look at the opening moments of the game, and then transition to another game that holds our interest more for our Roulette segment.

Enjoy the show, and we'll see you again in seven days!

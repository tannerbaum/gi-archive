  Replay – Toy Story 1, 2 & 3






            With Toy Story 4 in theaters now, we thought it would be a great time to look at how each of the first three films were represented in games. Our journey begins on the Super Nintendo with a side-scrolling look at Toy Story, transitions to Nintendo 64 for a 3D journey through Toy Story 2, and concludes on Xbox 360 with a familiar sequence from Toy Story 3. All three of these games are developed by different teams and are interesting for a variety of reasons.

This goes without saying, but we discuss all things Toy Story in this episode, and also speculate how Toy Story 4 will be. We'd love to hear your thoughts on this beloved Pixar series in the comments section below. Thanks again for your support of Replay! We'll be back again with another episode in just seven days.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

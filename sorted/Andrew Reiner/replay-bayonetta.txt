  Replay – Bayonetta






            In celebration of Bayonetta's 10-year anniversary, we're taking a look back at this stylish-action game, which is every bit as bonkers, over-the-top, and fun as we remember. This series, which will soon be welcoming a third entry exclusively on Switch, is created by Platinum Games under the supervision of Hideki Kamiya, one of the visionaries behind Devil May Cry.

We dedicate the entire episode to this classic game, and have a nice discussion about its place in gaming and what we are hoping to see in the next chapter. Enjoy the episode, and we'll be back in seven days (hopefully live) for another look back at a game from yesteryear.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

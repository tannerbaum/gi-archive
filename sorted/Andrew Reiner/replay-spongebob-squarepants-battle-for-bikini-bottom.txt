  Replay – SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle For Bikini Bottom






            Watch the Game Informer staff play as SpongeBob and Patrick in this (beloved?) platformer from yesteryear. Game Informer wasn't so fond of Battle for Bikini Bottom when it released, giving it just a 4.25 out of 10, and knocking it for focusing too heavily on collecting random things. We praised Heavy Iron Studios' work on the strange move set that SpongeBob uses to collect thousands of things, but grew bored of it quickly.

Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard heard people loved this game, and wanted to see why. Will he agree with their assessment or ours? We come to somewhat of a conclusion after playing it for a good 30 minutes. Whether you like it or not, Battle for Bikini Bottom ends up being an interesting game to reflect on, as it identifies both the positives and negatives of licensed games.

After looking at this game, we spend a little time with Alias, a game based on a television series that starred Jennifer Garner and was created by J. J. Abrams. The game didn't live up to the high standards of the show, but was ambitious in its missions and environment interaction.

Thanks again for watching this silly little retrospective show. We'll be back again in seven days with another episode!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Watch 14 Minutes Of New Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Gameplay






            At today's E3 EA Play event, the company unveiled the first gameplay for their much-anticipated Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The demo shown off presents a decent chunk of the game, clocking in at nearly 14 minutes. Here you can see how combat, platform, and all some of the parts between those two verbs will work. We also get to see a glimpse of some of the Purge Troopers, and some K-2SO-style droids, though they're not as quippy.

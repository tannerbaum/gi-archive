  New Gameplay Today – Devil May Cry 5






            The first time we played Devil May Cry 5 was at last year's Gamescom. This time, we were able to play as not just Nero and his many new arm abilities, but also as Dante and the new character V. Dante plays the way you might remember from Devil May Cry 4, while V sports a few clever twists that make him different than any other character in the series.

This time, I'm joined by Leo Vader, Joe Juba, and Imran Khan, as Imran takes us through a few levels of the game, talks about how each character plays, and shares a few interesting tidbits about the lore of Devil May Cry.

  Destiny 2: Forsaken's Scorn Are A Different Kind Of Enemy






            Destiny 2: Forsaken will introduce an entirely new breed of enemy: The Scorn. These aren't makeovers of existing enemies, and while they're technically reanimated Fallen, you won't be able to recognize them as such; the two look only remotely similar. You'll also have to learn a few new tricks to deal with the many breeds of Scorn, who are much more aggressive than other races, and will offer new challenges for Guardians to overcome.

In this exclusive video interview, we talk to Forsaken game director Steve Cotton and design director Del Chafe about some of the new enemy types in the expansion, detailing how each of them differs from previous enemies, how they complement each other, and how they mesh with the rest of the Destiny 2's combat as a whole.

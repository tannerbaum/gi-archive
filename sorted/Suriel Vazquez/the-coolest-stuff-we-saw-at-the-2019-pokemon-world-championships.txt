  The Coolest Stuff We Saw At The 2019 Pokémon World Championships






            The Pokémon World Champions are upon us! The event hosts several competitive events (for the Pokémon Trading Card Game, Ultra Sun & Moon, Pokkén, and Pokémon Go), but it's also a fairly large convention of its own, where fans of Pokémon can meet up, play a few games, lounge around, or visit the Pokémon Center shop, which has items exclusive to Worlds.

We've walked the show floor and various other areas and managed to (Pokémon) Snap a few photos of the event!

First off, the show floor. It's massive! Not only is there a convention hall filled with all sorts of demos, player halls, and more, but the adjacent areas are also decked out with some familiar characters.

While we were running around the hotel snapping photos, we also caught up with Victoria, a young Alolan Vulpix cosplayer!

The show floor also has a small gift shop where you can buy lots of Poké-themed items.

Of course, if you want the really cool stuff, you'll have to head to the Pokémon Center store, which has a number of World-exclusive items, themed around the Washington, D.C. area and a general archaeological theme.

There's tons more to buy in the store, even outside the exclusive items.

So there you go! Although Worlds is a much bigger event than these photos can really convey, this should give you a good idea of what the show is like. It's a good time.

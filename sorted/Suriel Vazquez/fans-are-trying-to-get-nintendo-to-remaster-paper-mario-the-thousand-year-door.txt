  Fans Are Trying To Get Nintendo To Remaster Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door






Fans of the second Paper Mario game, The Thousand-Year Door, have begun a campaign via Twitter and Change.org to convince Nintendo to remaster the GameCube RPG.

The whole thing started earlier today when YouTuber Arlo, released a video titled "Let's Get Thousand Year Door [sic] REMASTERED!" In it, Arlo expresses disappointment with recent entries in the series like Sticker Star and Color Splash, outlines his case for why The Thousand-Year Door should get a current-gen remaster, why it might not have gotten that treatment thus far, and why fans should spread the hashtag #RemasterThousandYearDoor on Twitter and social media to let Nintendo know they want a new version of the game. Arlo also set up a Change.org petition to have fans sign it in favor of the game getting a remaster (though this particular prong of the campaign approach isn't likely to hold much sway).

The reasoning for the campaign, and why Arlo thinks it might prove effective, hinges in part on a 2016 interview with then-assistant producer at Nintendo Risa Tabata conducted with GameXplain, in which Tabata states Nintendo may consider a remaster of Thousand-Year Door in the future if fans are vocal enough about it. Arlo's hope, of course, is that #RemasterThousandYearDoor counts as being vocal enough.

Fans then began spreading #RemasterThousandYearDoor on Twitter, expressing their own desire to see the game get a remaster. Other streamers, Youtubers, and prominent personalities got on board as well.

The hashtag quickly caught traction, becoming the number-one trending topic on Twitter in the United States, and the number-nine topic worldwide as of this writing.

At this point, it's hard to imagine Nintendo isn't aware of the campaign and fans' desire to see the game remastered. The question is whether it will do anything about it. Personally, I'd welcome a Switch version of Thousand-Year Door with open arms; it was the inspiration for several of my usernames at a formative time in my life. I'm still stuck with "Paperlink" on PSN, and can't be bothered to change it. Have you seen the possible consequences of doing that?

  Replay — Castlevania: Aria Of Sorrow






            With the release of Koji Igarashi's Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night capturing the feel of the genre he helped create, we thought now would be a good time to revisit some of the more obscure entries in that lineage. This time, we focus mostly in the Game Boy Advance Castlevania games.

Join Andrew Reiner, Kyle Hilliard, Leo Vader, and myself as we backtrack through a number of older Castlevania games, dissect running animations, do a little voice-acting, and more.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Did You Know Gaming Plunges The Depths Of BioShock Trivia






            Though it's been dormant since 2013, BioShock has become one of the most influential and popular games of all time, sparking a few sequels, millions of fans, and an endless sea of high-minded critique and thought.

Did you know gaming has a few bits of trivia you might not have known before. For example, Ken Levine originally had to pitch the game a little on-the-spot at the time, and originally came up on a tropical island setting for the game (Nazis would live there) before shifting gears to the iconic underwater city of Rapture. Other bits of intel include the ARG-esque marketing campaign for BioShock 2, and how Irrational Games struggled to create the character of Elizabeth.

  Here's What A Public Event In Destiny 2: Forsaken's Dreaming City Looks Like






            Destiny 2: Forsaken's campaign takes place primarily on The Tangled Shore, a collection of strung-together asteroids where the Barons reside. Eventually, however, players will make their way to The Dreaming City, a beautifully, ethereal place. What you're doing there, and what secrets you might uncover we won't spoil, but we can confirm at least one thing: There will be Public Events there.

We have new, exclusive footage of The Dreaming City in action, as we run through a new type of Public Event in this endgame location. The event has you powering up a generator, then defending it from a deluge of enemies to prevent it from shutting down. Eventually, as the generator deteriorates, you'll have to grab orbs dropped from some of the stronger enemies and run them back to the generator to charge it up again. 

It's a fast, no-muss, no-fuss kind of public event, though we'll leave it to players to figure out how to trigger the heroic version, which takes you to The Dreaming City's darker side: The Ascendant Realm.

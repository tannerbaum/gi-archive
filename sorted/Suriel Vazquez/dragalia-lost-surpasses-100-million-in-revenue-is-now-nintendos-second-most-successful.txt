  Dragalia Lost Surpasses $100 Million In Revenue, Is Now Nintendo's Second-Most Successful Mobile Game






Nintendo's mobile-only action-RPG Dragalia Lost has reached the hallowed territory of "game you don't hear about much but quietly rakes in a ton of cash."

Mobile app data information analyst company Sensor Tower reports the title has earned over $100 million in revenue across three million downloads, which is an impressive milestone for the game, since it only just released in September of last year.

For comparison, this makes it the second-most successful title for Nintendo on mobile. The title it just barely managed to edge out, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, released in November of 2017 and has earned $99 million. Of course, Fire Emblem is still the king of Nintendo's mobile lineup by far, earning nearly $600 Million since its release in February of 2017. For comparison, here are Nintendo's mobile games in order of revenue earned, as reported by Sensor Tower.

Fire Emblem Heroes – $591 Million
Dragalia Lost – $100 Million
Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp – $99 million
Super Mario Run – $72 million
Dr. Mario World – $790,000
Of course, Dr. Mario only released this month (and is pretty good, from one trusted source), so in time, it will likely reach the $1 million mark and beyond. And overall, this speaks to just how successful Nintendo's mobile efforts have proven, and is another sign that Nintendo will likely continue releasing their titles on phones, and possibly introduce more new series like Dragalia Lost, too.

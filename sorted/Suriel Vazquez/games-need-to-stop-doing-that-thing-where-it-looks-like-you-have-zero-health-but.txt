  Games Need To Stop Doing That Thing Where It Looks Like You Have Zero Health But You're Not Actually Dead






            Hey there! I know your online mouse clicks are valuable. Thanks for using them on this article after seeing a headline that's fairly self-explanatory.

Since the headline sums up my thoughts, I'm not going to waste your time with 1,000 more words on why the thing in the headline is bad. It happened to me in Sekiro and I wanted to vent.

Please click on the other pages of our website. I promise there are more words in them. Bye!

Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood


  Latest Trailer Reveals Samurai Class




Though it was announced last October, Stormblood hasn't received much love in trailer form. We got word of the Red Mage class a couple of months ago, as well as the inclusion of swimming, the Ananta tribe, and a new raid.  Though the game's latest trailer doesn't show that, either, we do get at least one more detail about the game: You'll be able to play as a Samurai.
The trailer (below) is entirely CG, showing two characters fighting each other in a high-octane battle atop a stone hand in the first half, then showing the samurai class cutting through bullets and decimating an alley in the second. Players who choose to play a Samurai will begin the game at level 50.
Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood launches on June 20.

  Watch A Guided Tour Of A Brand New Destiny 2: Forsaken Gambit Map






            Creating maps for an established multiplayer mode can be tough. Creating maps for modes that haven't released can be harder. And maps for modes like Destiny 2: Forskaen's Gambit, that mix PvP and PvE elements? Well, you get the idea.

There's a lot of thought put into these maps, so we talked to Bungie senior world artist Coolie Calihan and world artist Todd Juno about how a map for Gambit is put together. From the story the map wants to tell, to how its various paths were molded to be distinct and allow for expressive play, we take a guided tour of one of four new Gambit maps, Legion's Folly.

  Answering Destiny 2: Forsaken's Lingering Questions






            This entire month we've been revealing details about the content and changes coming to Destiny 2 with its first major expansion, Forsaken. But Destiny 2 is a big game, and while we had plenty of questions for the team at Bungie, we couldn't possibly ask them all. So for this special edition of The Game Informer Show, we're letting you ask a few! We sawt down with Destiny 2 game director Steve Cotton and Forsaken Project Lead Scott Taylor to get details about what kinds of new loot you can expect to drop in September, how lore and secrets will be distributed in the wake of the recent Whisper of the Worm quest, and throw in just a hint of horsin' around.

  113 "Rapid-Fire" Questions About Destiny 2: Forsaken






            As Destiny 2's first big expansion, there are lot of questions about what Forsaken will do to appease fans. We asked several of the more pressing ones, as well as several that were... less pressing. But Forsaken leads Steve Cotton and Scott Taylor were such good sports they actually managed to break the patented Rapid-Fire format, and you can see it fall apart before your very eyes as we ask them about whether Light or Power is stronger, how milestones might be changing, the length of Forsaken's campaign, and more. We also suggested several gun names for their evaluation. Will any of them make it into the final game? Probably not.

  New Gameplay Today - Destiny 2: Forsaken's Second Campaign Mission






            In a summer crossover event that should please fans of both Destiny 2 and New Gameplay Today, the latest episode of NGT is also part of our month of Destiny 2: Forsaken coverage! This means we get to bring on Destiny 2 lore PhD candidate Jeff Cork to talk about some of his favorite parts of Destiny 2's fiction, a subject he knows a lot about.

So join us for a look at the second mission in Forsaken's campaign, "Scorned," as we talk about how Forsaken will hopefully improve on the storytelling in Destiny 2's main campaign and DLC with a more serious tone, the Barons, and our favorite kinds of fanatics.

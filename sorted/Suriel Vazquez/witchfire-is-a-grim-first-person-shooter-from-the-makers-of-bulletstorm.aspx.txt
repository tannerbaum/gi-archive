  Witchfire Is A Grim First-Person Shooter From The Makers Of Bulletstorm






The Astronauts, creators of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, are working on a new, grim-looking shooter. That sounds, weird, but it makes sense.

Witchfire looks to be a frantic, run-and-gun first-person shooter with old-school guns and grim-looking enemies. The Astronauts is made of folks from People Can Fly (creators of Bulletstorm and the Painkiller), so it's a return-to-form for many of the people working on it. You can watch the trailer below.

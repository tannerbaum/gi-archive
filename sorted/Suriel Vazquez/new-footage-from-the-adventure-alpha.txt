To accompany the announcement of the alpha, developer Night Dive studios has released a new trailer showing off the remake.

Fans of the original should be able to recognize most of the levels shown, even if they've been retooled with higher-resolution textures. Of course, this being an alpha, the actual look of the game has not been finalized. "Not only will these re-tooled textures make the Adventure Alpha more interesting but it will provide the team with a blueprint of how to approach updated art, lighting, level design, and more," the studio posted.

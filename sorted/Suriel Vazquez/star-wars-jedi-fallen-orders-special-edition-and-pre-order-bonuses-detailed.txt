  Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order's Special Edition And Pre-Order Bonuses Detailed






Along with a look at how Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order plays, EA today unveiled what sorts of bonuses fans can expect from its special edition, as well as if they pre-order.

Pre-ordering will get you four digital cosmetic items: Three skins for Cal's lightsaber, and the "Bee-D-1" skin for BD-1. The special edition will run you an extra $10 and include crimson BD-1 and mantis skins, a digital art book, and a collection of "director's cut" behind-the-scenes feature videos. Here's an image breaking down these bonuses.

It's not the most ambitious set of bonuses out there, but I'm personally more interested in the behind-the-scenes videos than another statue.

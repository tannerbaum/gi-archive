Following in the grand tradition of recent sports games upping their narrative game, NBA 2K18 will feature The Neighborhood, a single-player mode that also acts as a kind of social hub. You can get a full breakdown of the mode by reading Matt Bertz' preview of it here.
Ahead of the game's release, however, 2K has announced it is releasing a demo for The Neighborhood called "The Prelude," on Friday, September 8. The mode will offer players a way to introduce themselves to the mode, then migrate their progress into the full game when it releases the following week on September 15.

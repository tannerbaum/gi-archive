Bandai Namco has revealed the newest character to join Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, some new modes, and an open beta for the game, arriving soon.
Majin Vegeta will join the game's diverse cast of characters from the world of Dragon Ball. Majin Vegeta is a version of the character under the mind control of the sorcerer Babidi. While under his control, he turned on his friends in order to gain more power, eventually breaking free from Babidi's grasp. You can see him in action in the trailer below.
The trailer also shows off the new Expert Mission mode, which has six players taking on powerful bosses such as Broly, Great Ape Vegeta, and Turles.
Finally, Bandai Namco announced an open beta of the game will happen soon, but did not give specific dates. You can read Kyle Hilliard's review of the first Dragon Ball Xenoverse here.

  New Gameplay Today – Samurai Shodown






            Samurai Shodown is back this year! Whether you played SamSho (that's what cool people call the series to save time) when it released over 20 years ago, or have seen some of its characters pop up in other games, the return of the classic sword-fighting franchise should be a welcome sight. That sight happens to pretty nice, too, what with the watercolor look and all. 

Jeff Cork and Leo Vader join me on the latest episode of New Gameplay Today to show off a few matches of the latest entry, talk about SNK's recent history, and more.

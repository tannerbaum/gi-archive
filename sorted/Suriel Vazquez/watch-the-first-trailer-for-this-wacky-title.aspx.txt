Nintendo had a few surprises up its sleeve at this year's E3, even after their thirty-minute spotlight ended. During their Treehouse livestream, they announced a new 3DS Metroid title, Samus Returns. They also announced Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido, a game whose look and gameplay look to be as ridiculous as its title.
Developed by indieszero (Electroplankton, NES Remix), the game has players building match three-style combos out of plates of food, then using the plates earned from those combos to attack their opponent. IT also looks to have a single-player mode with light exploration and dialogue.

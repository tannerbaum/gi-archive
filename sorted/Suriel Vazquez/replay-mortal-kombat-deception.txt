  Replay – Mortal Kombat: Deception






            Although 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot sparked a huge wave of interest in the fighting-game franchise, it was built off the back of what many would call the series' worst era. In the PlayStation 2 days, Mortal Kombat was a 3D fighting franchise, and while the fighting itself wasn't at its best, a number of modes and cool (kool?) features made sure fans stuck around long enough for the series to return to its glory days.

Andrew Reiner and I are joined by interns Hunter Wolfe and Jay Guisao to look at a time when Mortal Kombat games had Chess, Puzzle, and Konquest modes, and featured absolutely no fatalities. Nope, none whatsoever. What could possibly make you doubt me?

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

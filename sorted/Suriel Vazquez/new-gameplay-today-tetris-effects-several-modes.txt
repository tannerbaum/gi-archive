  New Gameplay Today - Every Mode In Tetris Effect






            Tetris Effect impressed us back at E3 based on our initial impressions of it as "Lumines but you play Tetris instead." As it turns out, however, there's more to Enhance's take on Tetris than that.

Enhance's own Tetsuya Mizuguchi and Mark MacDonald swung by the Game Informer office to show off the game and give us a rundown of what to expect when the game releases on November 9. There are a lot of modes here, and some of them do some trippy things to Tetris. You can also check out our written preview of this build of the game, as well as a fun, extended interview with Mizuguchi and MacDonald on the latest episode of the Game Informer Show.

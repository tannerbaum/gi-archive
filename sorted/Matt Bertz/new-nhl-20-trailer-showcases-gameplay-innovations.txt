            Last month we broke down all the new gameplay features coming to NHL 20, including signature shots for superstars, contextual shot animations, and reworked goalie animations/puck pickups. Today EA Sports dropped a trailer showcasing how these innovations differ from last year's game. 

As you can see in the trailer, upon first impression these changes seem to be positive steps forward for the gameplay. But as with every entry, we'll have to get more time on the sticks before we know for sure they fix the problems a lot of players had with dangles, snipes, and saves. We'll have a lot more info to share on the game in the coming weeks. 

NHL 20 comes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this September. The Play First trial for EA Access members begins September 5. Those who pre-order the Deluxe or Ultimate editions can jump on the ice September 10, and the worldwide launch happens on September 13.

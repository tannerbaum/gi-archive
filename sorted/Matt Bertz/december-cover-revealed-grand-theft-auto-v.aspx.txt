  December Cover Revealed: Grand Theft Auto V






UPDATE: The issue is now available on Mac/PC, iOS, and Android. Go get your copy! 
The long wait is over at last. With the December issue, Grand Theft Auto V fans can pore over every detail we could get about Rockstar Games' highly anticipated sequel. Over the course of 18 pages (our biggest cover story yet!), we introduce the three main protagonists, discuss the groundbreaking way you use them, and explore the reimagined Los Santos – the biggest open world Rockstar has created to date. The massive feature also divulges and dissects many more aspects of the game fans won't want to miss.
In addition to our GTA V blowout, Joe Juba interviews Will Wright and others to tell the oral history of Maxis (celebrating its 25th anniversary this year), and takes the new SimCity for a spin. We also devote six pages to exploring the islands of Far Cry 3, discuss the impact of Cliff Bleszinksi leaving Epic Games, and share our top gift picks in the 2012 holiday buying guide. Check out the full covers below:

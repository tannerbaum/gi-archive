  Here Is The Full List Of Announced Nintendo Switch Games






In the aftermath of yesterday's Nintendo Switch reveal event, we finally have an idea of what the game library will look like from the March 3 launch forward. 
As we expected, third parties are still treading lightly, kicking the tires of the platform with a small collection of games. One of the few exceptions to this trend is Square Enix, which revealed a list of five games for the Switch. A surprisingly big collection of indie games accompanies the list of familiar franchise. You can get the big picture right here:

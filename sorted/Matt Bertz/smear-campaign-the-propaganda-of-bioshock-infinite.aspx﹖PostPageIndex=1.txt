  Smear Campaign: The Propaganda of BioShock Infinite






Desperately clinging to power in the face of a populist uprising and struggling to win the ideological war over the identity of Columbia, the ultranationalists have created an aggressive propaganda campaign to sway citizens to its cause and warn those who stand against them. The messages boldly villianize citizens from less than Aryan backgrounds, call for citizens to question the purity of their neighbors, and even encourage children to take up arms for their cause. These antagonistic advertisements will be found throughout the city in the sky. 
Check out the divisive campaign yourself in this exclusive gallery.

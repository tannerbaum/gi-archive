  Fallout 4, Just Cause 4 Heading To Xbox Game Pass This Month






Microsoft's subscription service is due for another injection of new games, and if you like the number four, this is your month. 

Today Microsoft revealed that the 2015 blockbuster Fallout 4 (March 14), Just Cause 4 (March 6), Lego Batman 2 (March 6), and F1 2018 (March 14) are all coming to Xbox Game Pass. Just Cause 4 is the most surprising addition, as the game just released this past December to largely lukewarm reviews. However, our own Jeff Marchiafava liked it, saying: "Just like any good sandbox game, Just Cause 4 gives you the freedom to make your own fun, and has kept me experimenting and entertained for hours after the credits rolled." 

What the subscription service lacks in numbers for monthly content drops, it makes up for with quality thus far. This is the second straight month of delivering high profile games to the service. This past February, Microsoft added Alien: Isolation, Batman: Return to Arkham, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

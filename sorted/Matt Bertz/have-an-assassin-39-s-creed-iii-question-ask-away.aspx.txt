  Have An Assassin's Creed III Question? Ask Away






A few weeks ago, we revealed Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed III to the world in our latest cover story. Since then, many of you have naturally had questions about the exciting American Revolution setting, new protagonist, and gameplay changes. Now's your chance to ask the makers. 
We'll take your questions straight to the team at Ubisoft Montreal and get the answers you crave. Obviously, the developers aren't going to spill the beans about everything in this podcast (pro tip: don't bother asking about multiplayer), but If you have any lingering questions about the information we shared about the game in our cover story or subsequent online coverage (click the banner below to check it out), share them in the comments section below. We'll select the best queries and ask them during in a special-edition Game Informer podcast with the dev team later in the month.

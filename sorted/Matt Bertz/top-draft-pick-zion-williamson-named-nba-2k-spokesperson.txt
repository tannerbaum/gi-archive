  Top Draft Pick Zion Williamson Named NBA 2K Spokesperson






            From his meteoric rise through Duke to being the number one overall draft pick in the 2020 NBA draft, Zion Williamson has had a year to remember. The phenom now has another accolade to add to his impressive resume – NBA 2K spokesperson. 

Today 2K announced that Williamson has signed a multi-year partnership with NBA 2K. The deal means we can expect to see Williamson appear in in-game events, social media, and consumer events. This opens the door to the new NBA star to appear on future covers of games in the 2K portfolio. Perhaps we'll see him on the cover of the next edition of 2K Mobile or NBA Playgrounds?

“I’m excited to officially join Team 2K and be a part of this global phenomenon, where people around the world can play as me," Williamson said in a press release. "I’m ready to put my imprint on basketball culture and be a part of the team that represents what’s next in the sport.”

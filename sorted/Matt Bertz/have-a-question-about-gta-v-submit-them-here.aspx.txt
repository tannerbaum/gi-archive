  Have A Question About GTA V? Submit Them Here






Since we revealed our December issue featuring Grand Theft Auto V, our Twitter and email accounts have been flooded with questions from fans eager to hear more about the game.  
We plan to answer as many questions as possible for you later next week with the information we gathered from Rockstar, but in the meantime feel free to add your queries in the comment section below. Please read through the comments before posting a question so we don't inundate the section with duplicates. 
Remember to visit our Grand Theft Auto V hub throughout the month to learn more about the game. If you want to pick up a copy of the issue, you can read about the various ways you can purchase it here.

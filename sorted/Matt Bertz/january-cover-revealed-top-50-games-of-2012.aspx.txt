  January Cover Revealed: Top 50 Games of 2012






With the year's biggest releases in our rearview mirror, we spent the better part of a month arguing about which games, characters, publishers, and developers rose to the head of the pack. The result of those heated debates is our 20-page Top 50 Games of 2012 cover story, which looks back at the biggest success stories and disappointments.   
Once you've read our take on 2012, tell us yours by weighing in on the Reader's Poll. Later this month we'll publish the results and compare them with the editor picks. 
In addition to our celebration of 2012, the January issue has several other features worth reading. Matt Helgeson digs into the history of developer Crystal Dynamics and finds a studio rich in high-end talent. Kimberley Wallace speaks with Telltale Games about the creation of The Walking Dead's Clementine, one of the most emotionally impactful characters of the year. We also report on the first three hours of Tomb Raider, deliver a verdict on the Wii U, and dive into Marvel Heroes, an MMO take on the popular Ultimate Alliance series.
Check out the full cover art below, which was created by the talented Sam Spratt:

  Game Informer's Third Annual Glitchie Awards






Sometimes they're entertaining, and sometimes they make you want to throw your controller across the room in frustration, but any way you look at it, glitches are an ever-present part of the gaming experience. Despite thousands of hours of play testing and millions of lines of code, almost no game is safe from the occasional technological breakdown. We combed the web to find video evidence of the most egregious and laughable errors. Here are the most notable gameplay glitches of 2012.

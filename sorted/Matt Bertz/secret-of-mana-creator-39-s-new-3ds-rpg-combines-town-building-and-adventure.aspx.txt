Ever Oasis


  Secret Of Mana Creator's New 3DS RPG Combines Town Building And Adventure




Even if you haven't heard of Koichi Ishii, you've probably played one of the games he's worked on. A longtime Square developer, his fingerprints extend from the original Final Fantasy and Secret of Mana through to the recent 3DS port of beloved Zelda game Majora's Mask. His latest project with Grezzo and Nintendo is yet another action/RPG heading to 3DS, Ever Oasis. 
A trailer released today fills in the backstory of the adventure. Players take the role of a young seedling named Tethu who must create a vibrant village in spite of the dangerous desert surrounding it on all sides. While you lead the revitalization charge by building shops and attracting residents, you must also try to rescue his brother from the clutches of an evil spirit called Chaos. You can watch the trailer here:

  Dishonored 2 Taps Vocal Talent From Game Of Thrones, Daredevil, And The Wire






The original Dishonored had no shortage of voice acting talent, tapping big names like Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), Lena Headey (Game of Thrones), and John Slattery (Mad Men) to bring its characters alive. The sequel is promising an equal commitment to quality with a new bevy of familiar voices from Hollywood, television, and even classic games in the stealth action lineage.

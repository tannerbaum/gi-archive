  Revealing The Story Of Halo 5: Guardians' Campaign






Over the last fourteen years, countless stories have been told within the Halo universe. We've followed humanity's struggle against the alien Covenant, the god-like Forerunners, and the parasitic Flood through the eyes of a wide roster of characters. Much of it has been told in a variety of media, but whenever there's a new game it moves everything forward in a major way. Halo 5: Guardians promises to do just that.
Franchise development director Frank O'Connor and writer Brian Reed sat down with us and explained the inner struggles and backstories of our heroes and villains and the overall big picture of the upcoming chapter in the Halo saga.

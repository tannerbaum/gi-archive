  Building A Better Deus Ex With Mankind Divided






The original Deus Ex is one of the most beloved PC games of all time, so the team at Eidos Montreal had a lot to live up to with their first entry in the series, Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Now the stakes feel higher for the follow up, Mankind Divided. 
Executive game director Jean-François Dugas explains what made Deus Ex such an important landmark in gaming, and how Deus Ex: Mankind Divided improves upon its predecessor in everything from boss fights to production values – bringing the cyberpunk experience to the next level.

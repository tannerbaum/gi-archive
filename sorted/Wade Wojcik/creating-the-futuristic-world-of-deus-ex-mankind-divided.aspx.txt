  Creating The Futuristic World Of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided






Ever since Adam Jensen's dramatic confrontation at the end of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, fans have eagerly awaited the next chapter of the sci-fi juggernaut. Since our cover reveal last week we'll be diving into exclusive details about the upcoming sequel from Eidos Montreal. 
In this video we sat down with executive game director Jean-François Dugas, executive narrative director Mary DeMarle, executive art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, and executive audio director Steve Szczepkowski as they brought us through their journey of creating the dark and mysterious future that embodies Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

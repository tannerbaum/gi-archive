  Mission: Impossible – Fallout Content Drops Into PUBG Mobile






            PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile publisher Tencent Games is partnering with Mission: Impossible – Fallout to deliver a month-long event based on the movie. The event is available only for the mobile version of PUBG from today until August 30.

During the event, players will experience Mission: Impossible-themed challenges, background music, and customizable parachutes, as well as the opportunity to unlock Mission: Impossible-themed outfits.

This seems like a random crossover, especially considering it's only available on mobile. I guess PUBG does have a lot of opportunities for sick, Ethan Hunt-style stunts.

  Death Finds A Way In This New World Of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth Teaser






            Blizzard released another animated teaser for World Of Warcraft's Battle For Azeroth expansion, this time turning the spotlight on Sylvanas Windrunner, Warchief of the Horde.

Sorry, this video is not available

The teaser gives us a look at Sylvanas' un-death at the hands of Arthas Menethil. It also shows Sylvanas burning Teldrassil (the "world tree" home of the night elves), an event which sets off the conflict in the Battle For Azeroth expansion.

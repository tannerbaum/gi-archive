Ben Reeves gave Splinter Cell: Blacklist a 9/10 when it released in 2013, saying the game "gives you the flexibly to be the kind of think-on-his-feet spy that Jason Bourne would idolize."

These solid stealth games are a step up from last month's addition of Sensible World Of Soccer, GRID Autosport, and Fable Heroes. Today is also the last day to get Splinter Cell: Conviction free through Games With Gold.

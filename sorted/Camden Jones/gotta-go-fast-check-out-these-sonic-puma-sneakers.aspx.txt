  Gotta Go Fast? Check Out These Sonic Puma Sneakers






The Puma x Sega RS-0 Sonic and Dr. Eggman sneakers are set to release on June 10. Both sets will retail for $130.
The Sonic sneakers include a blue suede texture meant to resemble the blue hedgehog's fur, and red soles meant to look like his shoes. There's also a strip of pixelated green pattern in the back and a yellow checkered pattern on the side, representing the Green Hill Zone frequently featured in Sonic games.

The Dr. Eggman sneakers feature a bold red color scheme with red and yellow stripes on the side, resembling the doctor's Eggmobile. The red is a bit garish, but the design is generally a subtle enough Sonic reference to wear in public (unlike the furry blue shoes).
Each sneaker includes little gold rings near the end of one of its laces.

Sega and Puma originally announced the collaboration back in March.

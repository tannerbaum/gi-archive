The new hires are as follows:

Brian Westergaard, lead producer of God Of War (2018) and Rise Of The Tomb Raider
Annie Lohr, a recruiter who formerly worked at Respawn Entertainment, Riot Games, and Microsoft Studios
Christian Cantamessa, writer of Read Dead Redemption and Middle Earth: Shadow Of War
Blake Fischer, senior director of portfolio planning at Microsoft for 16 years
Daniel Neuburger, co-director of Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider 
Lindsey McQueeney, hired as The Initiative's HR and culture manager
Westergaard, Neuburger, and Cantamessa are particularly significant hires, especially given that Phil Spencer teased that The Initiative would be working on a narrative-based game.

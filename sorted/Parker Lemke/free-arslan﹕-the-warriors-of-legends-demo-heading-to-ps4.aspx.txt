Today Koei Tecmo announced it will bring a free demo of Arslan: The Warriors of Legend to the PlayStation 4. The upcoming action game is based on the anime and manga adaptation of The Heroic Legends of Arslan. 
The demo will launch January 12, 2016 on the PlayStation Network, and will include a mission from the first stage. Players will guide two characters, Arslan and his protector Daryun, through a tutorial that showcases moves and powers like Mardan Rush and Weapon Arts special attacks. Check out the November gameplay trailer for a look at how game's combat works.
Along with the demo, Koei Tecmo announced it will incorporate the character Elam's culinary skills in the gmae. Players will be able to collect recipes and boost character abilities during battle preparations. These can include increased health, attack boosts, healing, bonus gold, and extra experience.
Arslan: The Warriors of Legend is slated to release for the PS4 and Xbox One on February 9, 2016. A digital-only version will also be available for the PS3.

  Check Out This Hilariously Botched Just Cause 3 Plane Takeoff 






In a game with as much destructive potential as Just Cause 3, the laws of physics are bound to break at some point.Â 
A crazy aerial stunt seen in a recent Reddit clip shows there's no shortage of potential silliness when experimenting with its open-world toys. 

Uploaded by tehSlothman, the botched coastal takeoff takes an unexpected turn as the plane bounces off the ocean surf and spins like a figure skater in mid-air before exploding. Even by Rico Rodriguez standards, that takes action movie antics to a new extreme.

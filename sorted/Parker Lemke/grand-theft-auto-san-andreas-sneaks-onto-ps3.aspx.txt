  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Sneaks Onto PlayStation Store






A PS3 port of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas appeared on the PlayStation Store today. The stealth release is priced at $14.99. 
Rockstar's 90's-infused crime sandbox previously came out on last-gen systems with a Xbox 360 port in late 2014, sporting 720p resolution visuals, an improved draw distance, and achievements.
PlayStation LifeStyle uncovered an Amazon listing for the PS3 port yesterday, along with a Exophase gallery of its Trophy List. Seemingly coinciding with the game's PS3 release, its PS2 Classics version appears to no longer be available for purchase on the PlayStation Store.

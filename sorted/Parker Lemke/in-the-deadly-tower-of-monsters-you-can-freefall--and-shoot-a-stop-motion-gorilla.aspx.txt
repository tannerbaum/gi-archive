Today Atlus shared a new trailer for The Deadly Tower of Monsters, an ACE Team-developed video game tribute to classic B-movies, that shows off its freefall mechanics. Watch as interstellar hero Dick Starspeed jumps through the air with his trusty jetpack to reach lower levels in the goofy, stunt-filled sci-fi spoof.

Freefalling lets players traverse the game's tower environments and jump through rings to collect awards. You can also reach secret areas, or splatter yourself on the ground if you don't time your boosters properly.
The Deadly Tower of Monsters is priced at $14.99, and will come out January 19, 2016 on Steam and the PS4. Check out our prior coverage for more details.

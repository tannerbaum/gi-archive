  Remedy Provides Update On Control 2, Says Max Payne Remakes Are In 'Production Readiness Stage'






            Remedy Entertainment released Alan Wake 2 last week, and both fans and critics alike seem to be pleased with the long-awaited sequel – you can read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review here. And now, just a few days later, the studio has provided some updates to some games it has in development, including Control 2 and its remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. 

In its latest earnings report for the third quarter of 2023, Remedy says, "Alan Wake 2 launched with great reception, laying the foundation for [the] future," although with the game having just launched, it has nothing to share on the financial performance of the game. However, the studio says, "[We] continue enhancing Alan Wake 2 with new updates and developing the two announced expansions to the game," adding that "Alan Wake 2 marks the first of many great new game launches enabled by our multi-project model, which we have built over the years." 

Regarding those other games, Remedy has revealed that Condor, its cooperative multiplayer game, has progressed from the proof-of-concept stage to a production readiness stage, stating it has "acquired valuable insights into developing service-based games and are now in a better position to create a game players can engage with for years." 

Codename Vanguard, Remedy's multiplayer game it's making in partnership with Tencent, is set to hit the "proof-of-concept" stage by the end of the year. 

In April of last year, the studio revealed it was remaking Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne after striking a deal with Rockstar Games, which holds the rights to the series. Now, a year and a half later, Remedy says Max Payne 1 & 2 remake (which is a single game) has "progressed into the production readiness stage." 

"We have gained clarity on the style and scope of the game, and we have an exceptionally well-organized team working on it," the earnings report says. "With these accomplishments, we are excited about the project and its future success." 

And finally, Remedy's earning reports state that Control 2 continues to be in the proof-of-concept stage. "The plans for this sequel are ambitious, and we have seen good progress both in the designs and in the game build," it reads. "We have acquired valuable insights into developing service-based games and are now in a better position to create a game players can engage with for years." 

Remedy says that with Alan Wake 2 launched, all four of these upcoming games will "benefit from the additional talent transferring from Alan Wake 2 as it will enable the teams to take the necessary steps towards the next stages of development."

  Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown 'Divine Trials' DLC Available Now, Story DLC Out This September






            Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Divine Trials" DLC is now available to all players for free, and it brings with it revisited boss fights, puzzle and platforming challenges, new amulets and outfits, and more. Plus, publisher Ubisoft has revealed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's "Mask of Darkness" story DLC hits the game this September. 

Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window. However, the Divine Trials DLC, which follows the free Warrior's Path and Boss Attack DLC from earlier this year, looked great in a new trailer released during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase. 

Check out a glimpse of Mask of Darkness and a look at Divine Trials in the trailer below:

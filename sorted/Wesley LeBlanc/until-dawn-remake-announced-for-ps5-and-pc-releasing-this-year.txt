  Until Dawn Remake Announced For PS5 And PC, Releasing This Year






            Sony has revealed that a remake of Until Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. Notably, this PC release means more people will get to experience developer Supermassive Games' breakout narrative-driven horror. However, it's unclear if Supermassive is developing this or if a different team is handling it. 

PlayStation revealed this new version of Until Dawn, which it says has been "rebuilt" for PS5, during today's State of Play in a new cinematic trailer that highlights the improved fidelity. This new and improved version of Until Dawn comes hot on the heels of Sony announcing earlier this month that Shazam! director David F. Sandberg is directing a film adaptation of the game.

  Get Another Look At Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden In New Cinematic Trailer






            Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, the latest from Life is Strange developer Don't Nod Entertainment, hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in February. Ahead of its release early next year, the studio released a new cinematic trailer to highlight the game's narrative at The Game Awards 2023. 

While Banishers features intense action-RPG gameplay, it's also a Don't Nod game, which means players can expect a heavy emphasis on storytelling. And tonight's trailer speaks to that. 

Check out the latest Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden cinematic trailer for yourself below: 

"New Eden, 1695: Antea and Red are lovers and Banishers, trained spirit-hunters protecting people from lingering specters," a press release reads. "But when tragedy strikes and Antea herself becomes a ghost, will you honor your Banisher oath or sacrifice the living in a desperate bid to bring your beloved back?"

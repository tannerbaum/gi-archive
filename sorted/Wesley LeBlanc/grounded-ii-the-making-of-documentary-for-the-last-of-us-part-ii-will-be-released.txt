  Grounded II, The Making-Of Documentary For The Last Of Us Part II, Will Be Released Next Week






            Earlier this month, developer Naughty Dog announced Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II would be coming to its recent release, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, in a post-launch update for the game. Now, we know exactly when this behind-the-scenes documentary will be live: February 2. 

Grounded II will be added to The Last of Us Part II Remastered in a free update for the game on February 2, but you can also watch the documentary on YouTube the same day. The documentary and associated game update will both go live at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET.

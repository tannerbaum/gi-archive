  Rockstar Games Co-founder Dan Houser Reveals New Studio, Absurd Ventures






            Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has announced Absurd Ventures, his new studio. 

Houser was Rockstar's vice president when he announced in 2020 that he was leaving the company behind franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. At the time of the announcement, Houser revealed that he had taken an extended break starting in the spring of 2019. His last day at Rockstar, which he co-founded with his brother Sam Houser in 1998, was March 11. 

Now, three years later, Houser has revealed Absurd Ventures. This studio is focused on "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts."

It sounds quite ambitious and while Absurd Venture's official website features all kinds of visuals showcasing its style, there's nothing official in terms of projects announced at this time.

  Get A New Look At Phantom Blade Zero In New Gameplay Trailer






            Developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, which features plenty of gorgeous (and gory) fast-paced action. Though we still haven't received a release date, the game is looking great, and it will be playable at Summer Game Fest's Play Days this weekend, so we could soon hear how it feels to actually play. 

It will also be playable at a few other locations this year, including Gamescom in August and Tokyo Game Show this September. 

Check out the latest look at Phantom Blade Zero gameplay in the trailer below: 

Revealed as a new entry in the Phantom Blade series during a PlayStation Showcase last year, Phantom Blade Zero is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you control the Dark Raider, who is out for revenge against a group called "The Order."

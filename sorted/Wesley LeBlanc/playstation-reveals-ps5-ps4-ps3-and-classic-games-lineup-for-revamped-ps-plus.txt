  PlayStation Reveals PS5, PS4, PS3, And Classic Games Lineup For Revamped PS Plus






            Back in March, Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles next month. Today, the company has released a new look at the lineup of PS5, PS4, PS3, and “classic” titles that will come to the service. 

Many of these games are already available on the PS5-exclusive PlayStation Plus Collection, namely first-party titles such as The Last of Us Remastered, but many of these are new to Sony’s PS Plus service. Today’s unveiling includes a list of PS5 and PS4 games, PS3 games playable via streaming, and remastered PS4 games that Sony refers to as “classic” alongside original PlayStation and PlayStation Portable games. 

“We’re focused on adding high-quality titles into the PlayStation Plus service for players to enjoy,” Sony Interactive Entertainment vice president of services, global sales, and business operations, Nick Maguire, writes in a blog post. “I’m pleased to share a selection of the content that will be available for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium/Deluxe plans. PlayStation.com will be updated with the game list when it launches in your region.”

“Also, players who have previously purchased the digital version of games from the original PlayStation and PSP generation will not have to make a separate purchase or sign up to PlayStation Plus to play these titles on PS4 or PS5.

Sony says new games will be added regularly. Essential subscribers will see a monthly refresh occur “on the first Tuesday of the month…with new PS4 and PS5 games added to the service – same as what PlayStation Plus members get today.” Extra and Premium/Deluxe subscribers will get an additional monthly refresh that will occur in the middle of each month and the number of games “refreshed” will vary per month.

PlayStation says this revamped PlayStation Plus will launch on May 24 in Asia, June 2 in Japan, June 13 in North and South America, and June 23 in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. 

Last but not least, Sony provided some details about the service’s time-limited game trials. 

“The time-limited game trial benefit will enable you to try select games before you buy,” Maguire writes. “After downloading a trial of the full game, you can play it for two hours for most games – the playtime counter only counts while you are in the game. It’s a great way to try games before you decide to buy, and any trophies and game save data from the trial period will carry forward if you purchase the game.”

Here’s a look at some of the titles that will be part of the time-limited game trials: 

PlayStation Studios:

Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection | Naughty Dog, PS5
Horizon Forbidden West | Guerrilla Games, PS4/PS5

Third Party Partners:

Cyberpunk 2077 | CD Projekt, PS5
Farming Simulator 22 | Giants Software GmBH, PS4/PS5 
Tiny Tina’s Wonderland |  2K Games, PS4/PS5

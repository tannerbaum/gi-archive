  Vampire Survivors Free Whiteout Update Brings New Stage, Character, Weapon, And More






            Vampire Survivors developer Poncle has revealed a new "Whiteout" update coming to the game soon, and it brings with it a new snowy stage, character, weapon, and more. Alongside this news, Poncle released a short teaser of what awaits survivors in the Whiteout update, and it looks like a frosty new take on the Vampire Survivors arcade action. Unlike the Tides of the Foscari DLC that was released earlier this year for $2, this Whiteout update will be free on all platforms where you can play Vampire Survivors.Â 

"It's the first trailer for Whiteout, the new free update we're working on (patch v1.7)," Poncle's announcement tweet reads. "Get ready for a frosty new stage, a new character, weapon, and more. Coming soon to all platforms."Â

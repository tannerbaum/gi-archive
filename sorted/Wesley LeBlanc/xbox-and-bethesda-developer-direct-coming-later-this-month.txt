  Xbox And Bethesda Developer Direct Coming Later This Month






            Microsoft has announced an Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct, a new games showcase "providing fans an inside look at some of the games coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass over the next few months." 

It will air on January 25 and feature Xbox studios like Arkane Austin, Mojang Studios, Turn 10 Studios, and ZeniMax Online Studios. This Developer Direct will "focus on big features, extended gameplay showcases, and the latest info for Xbox games launching in the next few months," including The Elder Scrolls Online, Forza Motorsport, Minecraft Legends, and Redfall. 

You might notice a big galaxy-sized absence in this lineup: Starfield. Fret not, Xbox says a standalone Starfield show is in the works "to dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive" into the game. 

As for what to expect for each game, Xbox has detailed that too. For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023's major chapter update, "including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game's biggest update this year." A full "ESO Chapter Reveal Event" will follow this Developer Direct. On the Forza Motorsport side of things, Turn 10 Studios will be sharing more gameplay and new details about the game. 

Mojang Studios will showcase a new look into Minecraft Legends' upcoming PvP multiplayer experience and Arkane Austin will "showcase several minutes of gameplay" from Redfall, including both single player and multiplayer gameplay. Fans can expect to learn more about combat, customization, bosses, the open world, and more, according to Xbox. 

The Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct airs on Wednesday, January 25, at 12 p.m. PT/ 3 p.m. ET.

  Dave The Diver Surpasses 3 Million Sales 






            Dave the Diver has surpassed 3 million units sold, developer Mintrocket has revealed. The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. 

In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

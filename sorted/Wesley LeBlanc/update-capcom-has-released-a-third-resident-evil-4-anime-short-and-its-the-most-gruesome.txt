  Update: Capcom Has Released A Third Resident Evil 4 Anime Short And It's The Most Gruesome Yet






            Update, 3/23/23: 

Another day, another horrifyingly cute and disturbing Resident Evil 4 anime short to watch. Earlier this week, Capcom released Episode 1 of its "Resident Evil 4 Anime – Leon and the Mysterious Village," following it up yesterday with the release of Episode 2. Episode 3 is now available for viewing and it's the most gruesome yet (but also, still very cute). 

Enjoy!

Update, 3/22/24: 

Earlier this week, Capcom released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on Resident Evil 4 and now, just a couple of days later, the company has released another one. The first saw Leon attempting his way through the Village section of Resident Evil 4 but this time, we see him try to rescue Ashley Graham from El Gigante...and it doesn't go well. 

Check it out for yourself below:

Original story, 3/20/23:

The remake of Resident Evil 4 is finally out this week and ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on the game. 

In it, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy attempt to get through the curiously adorable Spanish village that serves as the setting to RE4's opening while searching for the missing daughter of the president, Ashley Graham. Things don't go according to plan for Leon, unfortunately, and well, you can see what happens for yourself in the anime short below: 

Let's hope our own journeys through RE4 go better than Leon's did in the short above. 

Resident Evil 4 (remake) hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this Thursday, on March 24.

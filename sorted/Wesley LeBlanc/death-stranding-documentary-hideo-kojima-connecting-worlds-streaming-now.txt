  Death Stranding Documentary, 'Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds,' Streaming Now On Disney Plus






            Death Stranding hit PlayStation 4 exclusively back in 2019 before launching on PC with a Director's Cut in 2020. As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. TitledÂ Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film "explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding."Â 

It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film FestivalÂ but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.Â

We haven't yet watched it but given Kojima's love of movies, we're excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release ofÂ Hideo Kojima: Connecting WorldsÂ follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development.Â 

For more, readÂ Game Informer'sÂ Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director's Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.Â

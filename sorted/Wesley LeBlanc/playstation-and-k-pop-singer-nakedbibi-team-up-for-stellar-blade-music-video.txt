  PlayStation And K-Pop Singer NakedBibi Team Up For Stellar Blade Music Video






            PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled "Eve," is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 

The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. 

Check out the "Eve" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below:

For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more.

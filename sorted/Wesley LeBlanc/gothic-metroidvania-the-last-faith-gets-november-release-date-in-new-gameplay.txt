  Gothic Metroidvania The Last Faith Gets November Release Date In New Gameplay Trailer






            Developer Kumi Souls Games announced its gothic Soulslike metroidvania, The Last Faith, years ago, and last summer, we got a new trailer that indulged in the game's pixelated violence. We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 

Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 

If you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal's brutal environment. 

"Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform," a press release reads. "Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.

"Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk."

The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

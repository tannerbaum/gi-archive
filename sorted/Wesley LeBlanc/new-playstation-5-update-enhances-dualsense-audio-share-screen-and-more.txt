  New PlayStation 5 Update Enhances DualSense Audio, Share Screen, And More






            PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 

The biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. 

"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model," a PlayStation Blog post reads. "Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience."

Share Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 

Finally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness.

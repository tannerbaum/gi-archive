            Nintendo has revealed pink Joy-Con controllers for the Switch alongside a new Princess Peach: Showtime gameplay trailer.

They will be available for purchase at select retailers and Nintendo's online store for a limited time, although Nintendo did not mention exactly when players can buy them.

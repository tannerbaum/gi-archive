  Scorn Impressions | New Gameplay Today






            Your hosts Wesley Leblanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Scorn, the new puzzle horror game from developer Ebb Software and publisher Kepler Interactive. The two discuss the game's narrative, or lack thereof, how Scorn works as a puzzle game, and ultimately, whether or not it's a game the two plan to continue playing.

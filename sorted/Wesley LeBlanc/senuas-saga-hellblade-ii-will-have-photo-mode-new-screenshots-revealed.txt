  Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Will Have Photo Mode, New Screenshots Revealed






            Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game's release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game's photo mode. 

While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. 

Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 

"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II," a Ninja Theory tweet reads. "Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week." 

Senua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024.

  Super Nintendo World Comes To Florida In Universal's New 'Epic Universe' Theme Park Next Year






            Universal opened Super Nintendo World, the first Nintendo/Mario-themed theme park, in Universal Studios Japan in Osaka in 2021. The first Super Nintendo World in the U.S. opened at Universal Studios Hollywood last year in California, with word that a Super Nintendo World was in development at Universal's Orlando, Florida, complex, which contains Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, and the water park, Volcano Bay.

Today, Nintendo announced that Super Nintendo World will open next year as part of Epic Universe, Universal's third non-water theme park in Orlando.Â 

Universal says Epic Universe will contain five immersive worlds, and one of them is Super Nintendo World. The other four parks are Celestial Park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter â€“ Ministry of Magic, How to Train Your Dragon's Isle of Berk, and Dark Universe. The How to Train Your Dragon, Super Nintendo World, and Harry Potter lands are self-explanatory, but Celestial Park will be a celestial-themed entrance area to Epic Universe and Dark Universe will be themed around Universal's classic monsters, like Frankenstein and more.

Nintendo didn't share much about what to expect at Florida's Super Nintendo World, but given the extra space Universal has in Orlando, fans are expecting the Mario Kart AR experience and the Yoshi's Adventure dark ride already in Japan. Universal Studios Hollywood does not feature Yoshi's Adventure. Universal Studios Japan is also developing a Donkey Kong-themed rollercoaster, set to open up this spring, and aerial drone footage of Epic Universe's development shows that ride is coming to Florida, too.Â

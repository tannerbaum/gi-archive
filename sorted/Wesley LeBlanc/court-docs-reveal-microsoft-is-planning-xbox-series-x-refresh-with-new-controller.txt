  Court Docs Reveal Microsoft Is Planning Xbox Series X Refresh With New Controller In 2024






            Microsoft and Xbox representatives appeared in court various times earlier this year to get its colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard legally approved. As usual, specific documents, emails, and more were sealed away from the public and press during court proceedings. However, various unseen documents have leaked, which is how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point. Other documents point to Microsoft's plans for an Xbox Series X/S refresh next year alongside a new controller that features gyro, haptic feedback, and more, as reported by The Verge.

The Xbox Series X refresh is known as "Brooklin" and, most notably, does not have a disc drive, much like Sony's PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, which costs less than the disc version of the PS5. Microsoft's internal documents state, "Brooklin will deliver 4K Gen9 console gaming with more internal storage, faster Wi-Fi, reduced power, a more immersive controller and a beautiful redesign that elevates the all-digital experience of the Xbox ecosystem."

Without a disc drive, Brooklin drops the Xbox Series X's rectangular shape in favor of a cylindrical one. According to the internal document, it will come with 2TB of storage for games, a USB-C front port with power delivery, Wi-Fi 6E radio, improved Bluetooth capability, reduced power, a more efficient standby mode, and more. It will include Xbox's updated controller and cost $499, the same price as a launch day Xbox Series X. 

On that new controller, internal documents reveal Xbox calls it "Sebile." According to the documents, it will feature haptic feedback, a feature in PlayStation's DualSense controllers, special haptics that double as speakers, an accelerometer, and quieter buttons and thumbsticks. Those thumbsticks will be modular, with "improved longevity [and] continued build improvements." Plus, a new "lift to wake" feature will seemingly let players pick up the controller to turn it on. Its battery will be rechargeable and swappable, too.

There’s also "Ellewood," which is the Xbox Series S refresh planned for next year if internal documents are anything to go by. It will cost $299, feature 1TB of internal storage, better Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the new "Sebile" Xbox controller, better power efficiency, and more. The document says, "Ellewood will deliver Gen9 console gaming with more internal storage, faster Wi-Fi, reduced power, and a more immersive controller, all for the same affordable price." 

Microsoft just launched a 1TB Xbox Series S this month, but it’s black and doesn’t feature some of the improvements planned for Ellewood.

The Verge reports that Microsoft is tentatively planning to launch the refreshed Xbox Series S in September 2024 and the refreshed Xbox Series X in November 2024.

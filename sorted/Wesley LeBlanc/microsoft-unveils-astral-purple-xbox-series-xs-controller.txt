  Microsoft Unveils Astral Purple Xbox Series X/S Controller






            Microsoft has announced a new Xbox Series X/S controller with a deep purple color scheme on the front and a bright white back. Aptly, this new controller is titled "Astral Purple." It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. 

Xbox says, "This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection," noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. 

Like most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you.

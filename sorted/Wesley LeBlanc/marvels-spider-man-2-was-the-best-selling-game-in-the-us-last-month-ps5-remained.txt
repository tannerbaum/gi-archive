  Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Was The Best-Selling Game In The US Last Month, PS5 Remained Top Console






            Video game analyst group Circana has released its October 2023 U.S. Video Game Market Highlights report and in it, the company reveals that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was the best-selling game of the month. The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, too. 

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 taking the top slot last month isn't surprising – it's the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever and sold through 5 million copies in just 11 days.

Circana executive director Mat Piscatella writes on Twitter that spending on video game content fell 4 percent in October compared to October 2022, to $3.6 billion. He adds that "growth in physical consoles software and mobile spending was offset by declines in other areas, particularly digital premium downloads driven by the release date shift of Call of Duty." 

Roblox hit PlayStation platforms last month and ranked 4th across all titles on the PS5 in terms of monthly active users in the U.S. It was behind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Fortnite, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 

The PS5 was the best-selling hardware platform in both unit sales and dollar sales for October 2023. The Xbox Series X/S came in second place for dollar sales while the Switch came in second for unit sales. Year-to-date hardware spending was 6 percent higher compared to the same period in 2022, at $4 billion. Overall video game hardware spending, however, fell 23 percent compared to a year ago, down to $327 million. Piscatella says, "All current generation consoles experienced a double-digit percentage decline in dollar sales compared to a year ago."

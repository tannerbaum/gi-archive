  Helldivers 2 Is PlayStation's Fastest-Selling Game Ever, Crossing 12 Million Copies In 12 Weeks






            Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever, the company has announced in its latest financial earnings call. It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War RagnarÃ¶k, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.Â 

Developer Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release â€“ Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation.Â 

Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement.Â 

As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!

It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes ðŸ¤¯

What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing @Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,â€¦

Notably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent â€“ PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella.Â

  Gears Of War: E-Day Is A Prequel Set 14 Years Before The First Game Starring Marcus Fenix






            Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day. 

In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules' Mad World (the very same Mad World from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. 

Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: 

"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."

Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." 

There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.

  You Can Now Design A Fallout-Themed Xbox Series X/S Controller In Design Lab






            Amazon Studios' TV adaptation of Fallout is right around the corner, premiering April 12 on Amazon Prime. You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. 

That's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.

As you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. 

It's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today.

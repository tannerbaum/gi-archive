  PlayStation Plus December 2022 Lineup Includes Mass Effect Legendary Edition And More






            This month's PlayStation Plus free games lineup consists of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Biomutant, and a brand new platform fighter called Divine Knockout. 

Because Mass Effect Legendary Edition includes three games, this month's lineup technically consists of five games: Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and the other two aforementioned games.

Here's what PlayStation has to say about each game: 

Biomutant | PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4

"Mix melee, shooting and mutant ability action in this open-world, post-apocalyptic kung-fu fable RPG. A plague is ruining the land and the Tree-of-Life is bleeding death from its roots. The Tribes stand divided. Explore a world in turmoil and define its fate – will you be its savior or lead it to an even darker destiny? Re-code your genetic structure to change the way you look and play, Mix and match parts to create your own unique slash, crush and pierce melee weapons, revolvers, rifles, shotguns and more. The PS5 version features native 4K and HDR support and three different graphics modes. "

Divine Knockout: Founder's Edition | PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4

"Launching directly into PlayStation Plus, this third-person platform fighter adds a whole new dimension to the genre. Damage enemies to make them vulnerable, then smash them out of the arena in a unique, third-person perspective. Choose from one of 10 playable gods to hurl boulders as Hercules or wield Mjolnir as Thor. Then battle across diverse arenas with their own mechanics to master. Play 3v3 Arcade mode with friends to explore a variety of game modes, or duke it out in hardcore 1v1 and 2v2 Duels. DKO features cross-play and cross-progression. This Founder’s Edition unlocks DKO and bonus content for the game, plus a DKO-inspired skin in Smite."

Mass Effect Legendary Edition | PlayStation 4 

"Relive the legend of Commander Shepard in the highly acclaimed Mass Effect trilogy with the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Includes single-player base content and over 40 DLC from Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3 games, including promo weapons, armours and packs — remastered and optimized for 4K Ultra HD. Experience an amazingly rich and detailed universe where your decisions have profound consequences on the action and the outcome."

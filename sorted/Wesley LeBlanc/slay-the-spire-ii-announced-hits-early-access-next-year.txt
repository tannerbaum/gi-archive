  Slay The Spire II Announced, Hits Early Access Next Year






            Mega Crit Studios has announced Slay The Spire II, a sequel to its mega-popular roguelike deckbuilder Slay The Spire released in 2019. Since that original release, the game has made its way to various other platforms beyond PC, including PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and even mobile devices. Now, players can expect the sequel to hit Early Access (presumably on PC) starting next year. 

This news was announced during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase with a quick cinematic trailer highlighting the game's beautiful animation. We see a few monstrous creatures and characters, presumably the ones we'll control, before "Slay The Spire II" flashes on-screen. 

Check it out for yourself in the Slay The Spire II reveal trailer below: 

As you can see, this Slay The Spire II reveal trailer doesn't contain any gameplay, but it does say the game hits Early Access in 2025.

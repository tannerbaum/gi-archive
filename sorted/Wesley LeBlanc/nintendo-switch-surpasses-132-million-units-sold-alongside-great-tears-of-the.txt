  Nintendo Switch Surpasses 132 Million Units Sold Alongside Great Tears Of The Kingdom, Pikmin 4 Results






            The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo's best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 

This news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 

It's possible the Switch reaches the DS' numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn't end sales of the hardware. And considering Nintendo said in February of last year that it's only halfway through its lifecycle, it seems like the company will continue to support it long after the rumored new-gen hardware is released. 

Nintendo's latest financial report also reveals that Tears of the Kingdom has reached 19.5 million units sold, with Pikmin 4 at 2.61 million units sold, making it the best-selling game in the series. 

"In addition, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles," Nintendo writes in its results. "Sales of other titles also continued to grow steadily, bringing the total number of million-seller titles during this period to 16, including titles from other software publishers." 

Unit sales for the entire Switch family of consoles, including the OLED model and Switch Lite, are up 2.4 percent year-over-year at 6.84 million units. That breaks down to 1.25 million standard Switch units, 4.69 million OLED units, and .9 million Switch Lite consoles. Total software sales are up 1.8 percent year-over-year to 97.08 million units. Digital sales accounted for 50.2 percent of total software sales, and digital sales are up 15.8 percent year-over-year, too. 

Despite rumors of a new-gen console from Nintendo on the horizon, it seems the Switch isn't slowing down. And next quarter's sales are likely to see a big boost thanks to the recently released Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

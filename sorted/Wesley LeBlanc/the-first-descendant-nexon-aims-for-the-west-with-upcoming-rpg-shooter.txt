  The First Descendant: Nexon Aims For The West With Upcoming RPG Shooter






            Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company's first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we're inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 

Ahead of the game's release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant's leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

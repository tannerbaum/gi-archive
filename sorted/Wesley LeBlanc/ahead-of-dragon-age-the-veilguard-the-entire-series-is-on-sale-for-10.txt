  Ahead Of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, The Entire Series Is On Sale For $10






            Dragon Age: The Veilguard is shaping up to be one of our most anticipated RPGs of 2024 – find out why in Game Informer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story – and if you're also excited about the game, you might be wondering if you should dig into the series' past. If you're thinking about a first-time playthrough of Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age II, and Dragon Age: Inquisition, or your twelfth playthrough, Steam has you covered because you can purchase all three games for less than $10 right now. 

Steam launched a Dragon Age franchise sale yesterday, with a 90% discount on all three games in the series. Here's the prices for each and the order to play them in if you want to start at the beginning: 

Dragon Age: Origins – Ultimate Edition (which includes the Awakening expansion): $2.99
Dragon Age II: Ultimate Edition: $2.99
Dragon Age Inquisition: $3.99

Ahead of Veilguard, which launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this fall, we highly recommend playing Inquisition as it ties directly into the new game. However, there will likely be appearances, cameos, and story ties from Origins and its sequel, too, so if you want to know everything you need to before jumping into Veilguard, this sale might be the way to go. 

For more about Veilguard, be sure to head to Game Informer's coverage hub, which features exclusive interviews, features, and more about the game. Here's some of what you can read about right now:

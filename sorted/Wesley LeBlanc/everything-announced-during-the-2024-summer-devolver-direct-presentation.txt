  Everything Announced During The 2024 Summer Devolver Direct Presentation






            This year's not-E3 weekend video game events have begun, starting with Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest showcase earlier today. Shortly after that, though, perhaps the zaniest publisher, Devolver Digital, took to the digital airwaves to showcase six of its games in the 2024 Summer Devolver Direct presentation. 

If you weren't able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you're excited to check out (or even its release date maybe), we've got you covered. 

Here's Everything Announced During Today's 2024 Summer Devolver Direct Presentation

Possessor(s)

Possessor(s) is a new game from Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, and it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC next year. It features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. and is set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. 

In the game, you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with ruined skyscrapers to explore and secrets about what happened to uncover. Devolver says the story features multiple paths in an "open-ended world structure" and upgrades to discover that allows Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, possibly hinting at a Metroidvania-inspired city layout. 

Tenjutsu

Tenjutsu is a jujutsu-inspired action roguelite from Sébastien Benard, lead designer of Dead Cells and solo developer at Deepnight Games, and it's coming to consoles and PC sometime in the future. If you're familiar with Benard's work, you might recognize Tenjutsu (48h version), which he released back in 2022 – Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of that 2022 concept. 

Devolver describes the game as a "fast and fluid rogue-jutsu," leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza "hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City." To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them "you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence." 

While you have to take down all four crime syndicates, you can do so in any order. As you do, you unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas to explore. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. 

Cult Of The Lamb: Unholy Alliance

Developer Massive Monster still isn't done with its 2022 hit game, Cult of the Lamb, as it's bringing full campaign co-op to it this August. The Unholy Alliance update hits the game on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat.

With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics. While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too. 

Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover. 

The Talos Principle II: Road To Elysium

One of our favorite games of 2023 – The Talos Principle II – is getting a three-part "coda" expansion next week, on June 14, called Road To Elysium. Devolver says it will reunite players with beloved characters and put your puzzle-solving skills to the test through a series of thought-provoking new stories. 

Road To Elysium follows the event of The Talos Principle II and continues the evolution of the robot world while providing you with a new perspective on some of the base game's key moments. This expansion consists of three chapters, each with a distinctive look and feel:

Orpheus Ascending: Set in Ancient Egypt, in this chapter, you will explore the philosophy of love, death, and resurrection through the story of Hypatia and Sarabhai. 
Isle of the Blessed: This chapter allows players to hang out with Yaqut and Miranda as they join Cornelius and Athena on a "puzzle-driven adventure set on a stunning Caribbean island." 
Into the Abyss: Devolvers says in this chapter, players will "return to one of the most dramatic moments from The Talos Principle II" to find out what happened to Byron when he was trapped in the Megastructure. 
The Talos Principle II's Road to Elysium expansion launches June 14 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will cost $19.99. 

Anger Foot

After delaying Anger Foot last year to 2024, Devolver Digital has given the first-person kicker (and shooter) a PC release date: July 11. 

If you're not familiar with Anger Foot, it takes place in the caffeine-fueled S**t City, and tasks players with putting the boot, literally, to a menacing menagerie of merciless gangsters.

"Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies, clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways," a press release reads. 

The Crush House

Devolver announced today that its reality TV-inspired "thirst-person shooter," The Crush House, launches on PC on August 9. However, the publisher revealed a new demo for the game is available to download and play right now. 

In The Crush House, you play as Jae, a new producer for The Crush House. As Jae, you'll take your camera into the show's Malibu, California, mansion to keep viewers glued to their screens by filming as much drama, romance, and tension as you can find. However, if you fail to keep the audience entertained, your show will get canceled. 

And that's everything announced during today's 2024 Devolver Digital presentation.

  Diablo IV's Vessel Of Hatred Expansion Gets October Release Date In New Trailer






            Blizzard Entertainment has released a new trailer for Diablo IV's upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion, and its looks gorgeously horrific. This trailer also reveals the expansion hits Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 8.

In the cinematic trailer, we get another look at the terrifying and dark world of Diablo IV by way of Vessel of Hatred's opening cinematic. If you're curious about what to expect, give it a watch – otherwise, it's likely the cinematic that will play at the start of the expansion later this year when Vessel of Hatred hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

  Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin Gets March Release Date In New Gameplay Trailer






            Team Ninja revealed Rise of the Ronin, its PlayStation 5-exclusive action game, during a State of Play last year. The game made an appearance at The Game Awards 2023 to showcase more of its fast-paced action alongside the news that it will hit PS5 on March 22, 2024. 

In the trailer, we see a Ronin take the steps to save a late-Edo period japan from chaos, dark magic, and more. While the trailer focuses on the game's combat, with trademark Souls-like Team Ninja action at play, it also highlights some of its traversal. Players will get to explore Japan on foot, on horse, and by way of glider.

Check it out for yourself below in the new Rise of the Ronin trailer: 

"Japan at the end of the 19th century was characterized by the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period of oppression and stagnation," the trailer's description reads. "Explore the vast world of late-Edo period Japan by horse and glider, while battling foes using a wide range of weapons and equipment – melee weapons like swords and spears, as well as ranged weapons like firearms and thrown weapons." 

Rise of the Ronin hits PS5 exclusively on March 22, 2024.

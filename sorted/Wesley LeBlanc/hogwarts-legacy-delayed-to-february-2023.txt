  Hogwarts Legacy Delayed To February 2023






            Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have delayed Hogwarts Legacy to next year. 

More specifically, Hogwarts Legacy, originally due out sometime this year, will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 10, 2023. The game will make its way to Switch, too, but today's announcement also came with the news that the Switch version will launch at a later date.

"Hogwarts Legacy will launch on February 10, 2023 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The Nintendo Switch launch date will be revealed soon. The team is excited for you to play, but we need a little more time to deliver the best possible game experience."

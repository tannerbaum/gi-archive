  Princess Peach Is Getting Her Own Game Next Year






            Princess Peach will star as the main character in a new game coming to Switch next year. 

Nintendo announced this during today's Nintendo Direct, stopping short of really any details beyond that. The company didn't reveal a name or any details about gameplay, but it did actually show gameplay and it looks exactly how you'd expect. We control Peach in a 3D world that looks reminiscent of something we'd see in a Super Mario RPG.

One interesting thing the Direct did reveal was that when Peach steps on a special pedestal, her outfit changes, going from her usual pink dress to a bright, light blue dress that seems to indicate she's powered up in some way. But the reveal ends there, with Nintendo promising more information at a later date. The last game to star Peach as the main character was 2005's Super Princess Peach for DS.

  New Nintendo Switch Online Update Includes Kirby's Dream Land 2, BurgerTime Deluxe, And More






            Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online subscribers now have access to four new games. 

More specifically, subscribers can play Kirby's Dream Land 2 (Game Boy), BurgerTime Deluxe (Game Boy), Side Pocket (SNES), and Xevious (NES). This new game drop comes just a few weeks after the latest, which saw Nintendo add Metroid Fusion (Game Boy Advance) to the service for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 

Check out these four new NSO games in the trailer below: 

"Save the day on the Rainbow Islands in Kirby's Dream Land 2 and feast on arcade action in BurgerTime Deluxe, both of which are joining the Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online collection," Nintendo's description of the trailer reads. "Plus, run the table in Side Pocket on the Super NES – Nintendo Switch Online Library and scroll your roll in Xevious on the NES – Nintendo Switch Online library. All four of these titles are available for Nintendo Switch Online members to play today." 

These four titles join a list of dozens more in the full NSO library. You can check out every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available via Nintendo Switch Online in our running list here.

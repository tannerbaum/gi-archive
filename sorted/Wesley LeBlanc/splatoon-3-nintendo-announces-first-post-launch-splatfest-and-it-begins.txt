  Splatoon 3: Nintendo Announces First Post-Launch Splatfest And It Begins Later This Month






            Nintendo has revealed when we can expect to take part in the first post-launch Splatoon 3 Splatfest, and we don't have to wait too long. That's because it's happening later this month!

More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we'll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you'd bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.

Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below:

The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

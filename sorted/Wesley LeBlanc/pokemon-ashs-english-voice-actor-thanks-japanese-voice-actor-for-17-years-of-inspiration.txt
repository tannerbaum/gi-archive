  PokÃ©mon: Ash's English Voice Actor Thanks Japanese Voice Actor For 17 Years Of Inspiration






            In December, TheÂ PokÃ©monÂ Company revealed that after 25 years, Ash's time as the main protagonist in the long-runningÂ PokÃ©monÂ anime was coming to an end. He had finally achieved his dream of becoming theÂ PokÃ©mon World Champion and now, it was time for new characters â€“ Loki, Roy, Professor Friede, and Captain PikachuÂ â€“ to take over.Â 

Today, Ash's journey came to an end in Japan (the dubbed version is coming at a later date) and the English voice actor for him, Sarah Natochenny, released a statement congratulating Ash's Japanese voice actor, Rica Matsumoto, and thanking her for 17 years of inspiration.Â 

"As I continue recording the final episodes of Ash and Pikachuâ€™s journey on PokÃ©mon, Iâ€™d like to thank and congratulate the incredible woman who has inspired my performance as the English voice of Ash Ketchum for the last 17 years, Rica Matsumoto.

I would also like to acknowledge everyone who has worked on PokÃ©mon in Japan, especially Ikue Ã”tani (v/o Pikachu), Shinâ€™ichirÃ´ Miki (v/o James), Megumi Hayashibara (v/o Jesse), Inuko Inuyama (v/o Meowth), & the current director Kunihiko Yuyama. Bravo, thank you, congratulations!"

Ash has been the protagonist of the mainlineÂ PokÃ©mon anime for 25 years and Matsumoto has been the Japanese voice for him the entire time. For the English dub, Veronica Taylor voiced him for the first eight seasons. Natochenny took over the role starting in Season 9 and has remained Ash's English voice since.Â 

With Ash's journey coming to an end today,Â TheÂ PokÃ©monÂ Company also revealed the title of its newÂ PokÃ©mon anime â€“Â PokÃ©mon Horizons: The Series.

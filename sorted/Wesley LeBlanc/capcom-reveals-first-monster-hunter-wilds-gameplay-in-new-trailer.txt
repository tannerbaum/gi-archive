  Capcom Reveals First Monster Hunter Wilds Gameplay In New Trailer






            Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today's PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 

We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you've played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting.

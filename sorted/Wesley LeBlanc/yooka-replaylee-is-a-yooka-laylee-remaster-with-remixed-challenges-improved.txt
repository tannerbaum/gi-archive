  Yooka-Replaylee Is A Yooka-Laylee Remaster With Remixed Challenges, Improved Controls, And More






            Developer Playtonic has revealed Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of its 2017 platformer Yooka-Laylee. It revealed this during today's Guerrilla Collective 2024 Showcase with a new trailer that highlighted the game's new visuals, improved camera and gameplay controls, remixed challenges, and more. 

"Embark on an epic open-world 3D platforming collectathon adventure with Yooka and Laylee," the game's description reads. "The search for Pagies starts anew in Yooka-Replaylee, the enhanced definitive version of the beloved indie darling with all new challenges, secrets, mechanics, and accessibility options." 

Check it out for yourself in the Yooka-Replaylee reveal trailer below: 

Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, and PC, and we had a great time with it – you can read why in Game Informer's Yooka-Laylee review. Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. 

Yooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window.

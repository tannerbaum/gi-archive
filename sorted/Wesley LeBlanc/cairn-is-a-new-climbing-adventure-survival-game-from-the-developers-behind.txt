  Cairn Is A New Climbing Adventure-Survival Game From The Developers Behind Haven






            The Game Bakers, the developers behind 2020's Haven, have revealed Cairn, a climbing game all about exploring (and surviving on) a mountain. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Cairn appears to be about a woman attempting to climb a very high (and difficult) mountain, only to die several times in the process. 

However, if the reveal trailer is any indication, dying isn't the end of her climb – just a part of the process. Though not confirmed, this premise seems to point toward Cairn being a roguelite, or at least a game where dying is part of the process. Rockclimbing treachery aside, the game looks beautiful.

"Reach a summit never climbed before in this survival-climber game," the game's description reads. "Climb anywhere and plan your route carefully, managing pitons and resources to survive the unforgiving Mount Kami. Discover what Aava is willing to sacrifice to achieve the ascent of a lifetime."

Cairn is due out on consoles and PC sometime next year.

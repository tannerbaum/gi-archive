  PlayStation Walks Back Helldivers 2 Changes, PSN Account Linking No Longer Required






            Update, 5/6/2024:

PlayStation will not be requiring Helldivers 2 players to link their Steam accounts to PlayStation Network accounts following widespread backlash from the game's community. This follows days of turmoil amongst players, leading to Helldivers 2 on Steam dropping from a "Mostly Positive"-rated game to "Mixed" for all reviews and "Mostly Negative" for recent reviews. Even the first Helldivers started receiving bad reviews as a result of this, according to developer Arrowhead Game Studios' CEO Johaan Pilestedt. 

"Helldivers fans – we've heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update," a post made today on X (formerly Twitter) reads. "The May 6 update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30, will not be moving forward. 

"We're still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable. Thanks again for your continued support of Helldivers 2 and we'll keep you updated on future plans." 

Following this news, Pilestedt took to X to thank PlayStation for the change while noting how impressed they are with the Helldivers 2 community. 

Firstly, I am impressed by the willpower of the @helldivers2 community and your ability to collaborate. Secondly I want to thank our partners and friends at @PlayStation for quickly and effectively making the decision to leave PSN linking optional. We together want to set a new… https://t.co/2rayksgH1v

With this change not moving forward, the Helldivers 2 community can hopefully return to killing bugs and automatons in the name of democracy, with no need for linked accounts or review bombing. 

The original story continues below...

Original story, 5/3/2024:

Developer Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony Interactive Entertainment have announced that Helldivers 2 on Steam will soon require a PlayStation Network account to play. All new players from May 30 will have to link their Steam account to a PSN account, and all current players will have to do so by June 4. 

Up until this point, a PSN account was not required to play Helldivers 2 on PC via Steam, and with the sudden switch-up, players have taken to the game's Steam reviews to express their frustration. Admittedly, the game's rating is still "Very Positive," with roughly 80% of user reviews falling into this category, but that 80% is lower than it has been in the weeks prior. And now, if you look at the game's recent reviews, you'll find plenty of negative ratings over the required PSN account change. 

SIE says due to "technical issues at the launch of Helldivers 2, we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional. That grace period will now expire." That expiration begins on May 6 for new players and June 4 for current players. 

While frustration is understood, it's important to note a PlayStation console is not required to create a PSN account – creating one is free and can be done online, no PlayStation 5 required. SIE encourages players to do so ahead of the June 4 change. 

"We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of," the announcement reads.

  Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Announced, Coming To Consoles And PC Next Year






            2K Games has revealed Sid Meier's Civilization 7, the next iteration of its long-running 4X turn-based strategy game. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Civilization 7 is coming to consoles and PC sometime in 2025. 

This reveal follows Geoff Keighley's teasing back in May that 2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its "biggest and most beloved franchises" at SGF. Many assumed it might be the next BioShock or Mafia game, but it turns out it was Civilization 7, the first entry in the series since 2016's Civilization 6 by Marvel's Midnight Suns developer Firaxis Games. In the reveal trailer, we get a look at various eras of history in a stylized cinematic trailer, but there's no gameplay to be seen. 

Check it out for yourself in the Civilization 7 reveal trailer below: 

Civilization 7 will launch simultaneously on consoles and PC in 2025.

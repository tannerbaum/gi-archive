  Puma Reveals Final Fantasy 14 Shoes 






            Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 

The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. 

Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 

Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers.

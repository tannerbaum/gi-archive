  Dread Delusion | New Gameplay Today






            After a few years in Early Access, Dread Delusion, an Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind-like RPG, is finally out in 1.0 on PC! And to celebrate the game's launch, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc, Kyle Hilliard, and Marcus Stewart are showcasing what to expect in today's New Gameplay Today. 

The gameplay you can watch below takes place about five hours into the game, with Wesley exploring an Eldritch castle of sorts. If you like what you see, you can up the game on Steam for $15.99 until May 16, which is when the price jumps up to $19.99.

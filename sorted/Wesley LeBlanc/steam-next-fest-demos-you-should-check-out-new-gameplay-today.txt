  Steam Next Fest Demos You Should Check Out | New Gameplay Today






            It's February, which means Steam Next Fest is upon us! If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! 

Game Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. 

Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: 

All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.

  Sega Cancels Creative Assembly's Hyenas And 'Some Unannounced Titles'






            Sega, the publisher behind next month's Sonic Superstars, has canceled some unannounced titles in development and Creative Assembly's first-person shooter, Hyenas. The company cites "lower profitability of the European region." 

As a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. 

"We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.," a Sega press release reads. "We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision." 

Sega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that "there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time." 

Sega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.

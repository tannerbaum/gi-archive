As you can see, even the minimum PC specifications require a somewhat powerful GPU like the GeForce RXT 2060, and that and the associated specs only get you 1080p/30FPS in-game. For a 4K/60 FPS experience, you're going to need one of the most powerful GPUs on the market, doubly so for ray-tracing. Notably, no matter where your PC falls in the specification lineup, Alan Wake 2 requires an SSD for storage.Â 

On the console side of things, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will have a 4K mode at 30FPS and a Performance mode that pushes the game to 60FPS. The performance mode will not be available on Xbox Series S, however.Â 

Alan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27.Â

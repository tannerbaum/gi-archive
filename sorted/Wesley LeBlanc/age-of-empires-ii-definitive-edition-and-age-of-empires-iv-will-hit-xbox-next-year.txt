            The Age of Empires series is coming to Xbox; well, some of it at least. 

More specifically, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, the 2019 remaster of the original 1999 Age of Empires II release, is coming to Xbox consoles on January 31, 2023, and it will be followed by an Xbox release of Age of Empires IV later that year. This news came alongside various Age of Empires-related news announced today as part of the series' 25th Anniversary celebrations.

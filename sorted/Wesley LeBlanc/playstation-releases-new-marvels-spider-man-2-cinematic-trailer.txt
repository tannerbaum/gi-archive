  PlayStation Releases New Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Cinematic Trailer






            Marvel's Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. 

The trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 

Check it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 

As you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20.

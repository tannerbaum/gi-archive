  Tales Of The Shire Is A Cozy Lord Of The Rings Game Coming Next Year






            Tales of the Shire is a cozy new game set in The Lord of the Rings universe and it's coming out sometime next year. Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 

Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 

"Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "Coming 2024." 

And that's all we know about the game. Here's hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.

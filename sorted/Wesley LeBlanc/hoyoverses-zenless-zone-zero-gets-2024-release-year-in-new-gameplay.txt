  Hoyoverse's Zenless Zone Zero Gets 2024 Release Year In New Gameplay Trailer






            Hoyoverse, the team behind Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, has released a new trailer for its next game, Zenless Zone Zero. Unlike its other two games, Zenless Zone Zero puts players in a futuristic metropolis in control of various characters capable of fast-paced, stylish action. 

Like Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero features an anime-esque art style, with its characters and much of its world looking almost animated. This new trailer, which Hoyoverse revealed during The Game Awards 2023, showcases more of the game's narrative and its third-person action.

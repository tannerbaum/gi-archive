  Robert Pattinson's Batman Suit Seemingly Added To Arkham Knight Before Quickly Getting Removed






            Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader's cinematic history because Robert Pattinson's suit fromÂ The BatmanÂ was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.

Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022Â The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNationÂ on Twitter and verified by GameSpot;Â Game InformerÂ was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, butÂ Game InformerÂ reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more.Â 

The BatmanÂ suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film,Â Batman, or Christian Bale's fromÂ The Dark Knight. Here's hopingÂ The BatmanÂ suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight.Â 

While we all wait to learn more, readÂ Game Informer'sÂ reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, readÂ Game Informer'sÂ Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.Â

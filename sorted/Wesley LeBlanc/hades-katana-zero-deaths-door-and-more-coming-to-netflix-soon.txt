  Hades, Katana Zero, Death's Door, And More Coming To Netflix Soon






            Netflix began building out its gaming efforts slowly before barreling quickly into a library that will soon exceed 80 games. Over the weekend, the subscription streaming service announced another lineup of games, including new releases like Shadow and Bone: Enter the Fold and Chicken Run: Eggstraction and titles previously released elsewhere like Hades and more. 

Some of these, like Oxenfree II: Lost Signals and Shadow and Bone: Enter the Fold are available right now on Netflix via mobile devices, but others like Hades and Braid: Anniversary Edition are "coming soon."

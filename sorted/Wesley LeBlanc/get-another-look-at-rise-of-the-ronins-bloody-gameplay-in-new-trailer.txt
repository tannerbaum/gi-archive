  Get Another Look At Rise Of The Rōnin's Bloody Gameplay In New Trailer






            PlayStation and developer Team Ninja have released a new trailer for Rise of the Ronin, and it features plenty of bloody gameplay and new details about the Bakumatsu period in Japan. There wasn't much new in the trailer, but it does tease the action that awaits players when the full game launches this March. 

In combat, various weapons can be used, including Japanese swords and spears. As you develop a connection with the inventor Igashichi, you'll gain more access to devices like the Fire Pipe, which is basically a long-range flamethrower. There are also bayonets, which can provide quick melee hits when using ranged weapons. 

Rise of the Ronin takes place during the Bakumatsu period, and your connection with the people of Japan will greatly influence how your Ronin's story plays out. You can read more about that in Game Informer's Rise of the Ronin preview here.

  Xbox Games Showcase: None Of The First-Party Trailers Will Be 'Full CG' 






            Microsoft announced last month that it would be holding an Xbox Games Showcase this month, immediately followed by a Starfield Direct focused exclusively on Bethesda Game Studios' upcoming sci-fi RPG. According to the vice president of Xbox games marketing at Microsoft Aaron Greenberg, during the showcase, none of the company's first-party games will be "full CG trailers," as reported by¬†GamesRadar.¬†

He goes on to explain this means every first-party trailer will be "either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematic" and each trailer will be labeled appropriately so it's clear what we're looking at. Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers.¬†

None of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.

This all started with Greenberg quote-tweeting an Xbox tweet that highlights that the Xbox Games Showcase is live in seven days (well, six days now) on June 11. He quote-tweeted this Xbox tweet to reveal that the showcase is "roughly two hours of non stop games, games, games, games, and Starfield."¬†

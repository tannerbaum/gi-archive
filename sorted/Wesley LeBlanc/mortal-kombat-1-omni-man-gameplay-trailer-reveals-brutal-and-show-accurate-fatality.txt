  Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man Gameplay Trailer Reveals Brutal And Show-Accurate Fatality






            Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 

The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 

Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

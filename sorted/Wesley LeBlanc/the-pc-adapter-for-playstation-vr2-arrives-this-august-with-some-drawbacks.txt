  The PC Adapter For PlayStation VR2 Arrives This August With Some Drawbacks






            After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation's online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 

Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn't happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder. 

Here's a look at the minimum PC requirements to use PlayStation VR2 on your PC: 

However, as exciting as being able to use your PlayStation VR2 device on PC is, it comes with some distinct drawbacks. 

"PS VR2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 – so you'll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC," the PlayStation Blog post reads. "However, other high-fidelity and sensory immersion features on PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games." 

PlayStation says the most immersive way to experience PlayStation VR2 will remain the PS5, even after this PC adapter is available for purchase. 

To set up the PC adapter, you will have to connect PlayStation VR2 to your PC using the adapter and the DisplayPort 1.4 cable. After that, download the PlayStation VR2 App and the SteamVR app from Steam. This will allow you to set up the device on PC, customize your settings, and play SteamVR games. 

The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will be available for purchase starting August 7.

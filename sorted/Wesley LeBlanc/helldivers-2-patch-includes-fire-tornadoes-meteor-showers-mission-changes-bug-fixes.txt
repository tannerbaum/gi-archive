  Helldivers 2 Patch Includes Fire Tornadoes, Meteor Showers, Mission Changes, Bug Fixes, And More






            Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has released the first major patch for Helldivers 2, and it adds additional environmental challenges to the game alongside mission changes, updates to weaponry, bug fixes, and more. It's live as of this morning and arrives less than a day after the team teased the incoming arrival of mechs as usable vehicles for players. 

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Minor Patch 01.000.100 is the addition of new environmental challenges that appear at random on many of the game's various planets. Arrowhead says that includes fire tornadoes, meteor showers, "and many more." The other big change affects Eradicate missions, which task helldivers with killing a specified amount of bug enemies in a small area. Eradicate missions now require more kills and enemies spawn more often, but the time to complete these types of missions is longer. 

Other changes in Minor Patch 01.000.100 include a decrease to the Breaker's magazine capacity (with increased recoil, too), decreased armor penetration for the Railgun, and more damage per second for the flamethrower.

Here's a full rundown of weaponry changes: 

Breaker: Decreased magazine capacity from 16 to 13, increased recoil from 30 to 55
Railgun: Decreased armor penetration in Safe Mode, decreased damage against durable enemy parts
Flamethrower: Increased damage per second by 50%
Laser Cannon: Increased damage against durable enemy parts, increased armor penetration, improved ergonomics
Punisher: Increased total ammo capacity from 40 to 60, increased stagger force, increased damage from 40 per bullet to 45 per bullet
Breaker Spray & Pray: Increased armor penetration, increased fire rate from 300 to 330, increased number of pellets from 12 to 16 per shot, decreased magazine size from to 32 to 26
Energy Shield Backpack: Increased delay before recharging
380mm and 120mm Orbital Barrages: Increased duration of the bombardment, decreased spread

This update arrives after the official Helldivers 2 X account (formerly Twitter) teased the arrival of Mechs. However, despite the tease, we still don't know exactly when to expect these machines to hit the battlefield – it sounds sooner than later though!

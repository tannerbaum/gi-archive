  No Rest For The Wicked | New Gameplay Today






            While the easy layup might have been a third game in the amazing Ori series, developer Moon Studios' next game after 2020's Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an isometric action-RPG called No Rest For The Wicked. It's the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game's opening hour or so. 

In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre. 

Check it out in the No Rest For The Wicked New Gameplay Today below:

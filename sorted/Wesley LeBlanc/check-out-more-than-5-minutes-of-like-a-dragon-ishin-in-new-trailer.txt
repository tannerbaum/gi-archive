  Check Out More Than 5 Minutes Of Like A Dragon: Ishin In New Trailer






            Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it's remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 

Now, RGG has released a new "Ambush" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below:

  Bramble: The Mountain King, A Spooky Adventure Inspired By Nordic Folklore | New Gameplay Today






            Join hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard as the two take a quick look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a spooky and horrific adventure game inspired by Nordic Folklore that plays like Little Nightmares. It comes from Dimfrost Studios and features gorgeous (if not terrifying) visuals and a fun loop of traversal and puzzle solving. And fortunately, you don't have to wait long because it hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC tomorrow on April 27. 

If you're wondering whether it's a game you should pick up, check out roughly 13 minutes of new Bramble: The Mountain King footage in the latest New Gameplay Today:

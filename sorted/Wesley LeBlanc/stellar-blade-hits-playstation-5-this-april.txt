  Stellar Blade Hits PlayStation 5 This April 






            We've seen little of Stellar Blade since its reveal way back in 2021, but during today's State of Play event, we got a new deep dive into the upcoming action game. Not only did we see plenty of gameplay in a new trailer, but PlayStation and developer ShiftUp revealed the game is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 26. 

Players will take control of Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad. Her mission is simple: save the planet. She was supposed to do this with the rest of her squad, but most were lost in the descent to Earth. However, she finds two friends in Adam, who lives on Earth, and Lily, a member of the 5th Airborne Squad who provides Eve with engineering support. Lily will help Eve unlock new abilities like Double Jump. 

Check out that double jump and more in the Stellar Blade gameplay trailer below: 

In Xion, a city built under the wasteland of Earth by the planets' last survivors, Eve is called Angel by the survivors, and seen as an object of both awe and fear. However, they'll loosen up as Eve shows commitment to building the city. Survivors will ask Eve for help with things like rescuing sisters in need or finding lost cats. These requests will send her out into the dangerous desert wasteland, where Eve will run into dangerous robots and alien-like monsters called Naytibas. 

Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024.

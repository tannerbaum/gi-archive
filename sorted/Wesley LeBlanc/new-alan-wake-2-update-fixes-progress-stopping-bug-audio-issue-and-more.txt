  New Alan Wake 2 Update Fixes Progress-Stopping Bug, Audio Issue, And More






            Remedy Entertainment launched Alan Wake 2, its Alan Wake sequel 13 years in the making, last month to the delight of both critics and fans – you can read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review here. Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it's one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.

Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 

PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9

Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.

Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  

Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.

And that's everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here.

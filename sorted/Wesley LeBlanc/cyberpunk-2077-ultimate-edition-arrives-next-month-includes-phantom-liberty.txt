  Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Arrives Next Month, Includes Phantom Liberty Expansion 






            CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it â€“ find out why inÂ Game Informer'sÂ Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here â€“ and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.

Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below:Â

All that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though.Â

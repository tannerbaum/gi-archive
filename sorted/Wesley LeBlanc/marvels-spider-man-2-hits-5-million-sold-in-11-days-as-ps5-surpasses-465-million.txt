            Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 – read Game Informer's review here to find out why we loved it so much. It turns out plenty of others enjoyed developer Insomniac Games' latest superhero effort, too, because Sony has revealed that in just 11 days, it sold through more than 5 million copies, making it one of the year's best-selling games.

For context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too.

As for how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 sold so well, it helps that its predecessors, Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales were so well-received. Plus, as of the latest financial quarter for Sony, which ended September 30, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 46.5 million units sold, creating a large community of gamers who could have picked up Marvel's Spider-Man 2. 

In total, the PS5 has sold through 46.6 million units in its lifetime, thanks to a strong second quarter in Sony's Fiscal Year 2023, where it sold 4.9 million PS5 consoles. That's 1.6 million more than the previous quarter. In this same quarter, Sony sold through 4.7 million first-party games – Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was not yet released – and, in total, 67.6 million PlayStation 4 and PS5 software, which includes any game released for the consoles. Sony says 67% of the games purchased for its PlayStation consoles during the quarter that ended September 30 were digital downloads. 

By the end of this quarter, Sony tracked 107 million monthly active users on the PlayStation Network, with 47.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers in the same time period.

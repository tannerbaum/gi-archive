  We're Getting Our First Tales Of The Shire Trailer Later This Month






            Developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division have announced the first trailer for Tales of the Shire, the cozy Middle-earth/Lords of the Rings-inspired game announced last year, is coming later this month. More specifically, we'll finally get a good look at the Shire in the new trailer on April 22.

As for what to expect, Wētā Workshop has shared little about the game beyond its initial reveal teaser. We know the game promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit lives, and that sounds great on its own, but we're excited to see what that entails from a gameplay perspective. If I had to guess, Tales of the Shire will fall somewhere between a life sim and a farming sim, akin to something like Animal Crossing but with Hobbits. 

Fortunately, we don't have to wait too long to find out because the first trailer for Tales of the Shire arrives on Monday, April 22.

  New Lies Of P Update Includes Various Changes To Make The Game Easier






            A new Lies of P update is live on PlayStation and Steam, and it includes several changes to bosses, standard enemies, items, and more that should make the game easier overall. The update is not yet live on Xbox platforms but publisher Neowiz says the Xbox versions of the update "have been submitted to Microsoft for testing and will be updated as soon as they are ready." 

Lies of P hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC earlier this month. It's one of our favorite games of the year – read about why in Game Informer's Lies of P review here – but it's a tough soulslike that kicked our butts more than once. However, today's Update 1.2.0.0 should make the game easier overall so if you've taken a break from saving Krat with Pinocchio, now might be a good time to jump back in. 

Here's what's changed in Update 1.2.0.0 in Lies of P: 

Balance Changes 

Decreased the HP of certain field monsters
Increased the chance of breaking some monsters' stance and the frequency of stagger
Increased the staggerable window time of field monsters
Decrease the HP of all 3 types of Dimensional Butterflies

Increased the drop rate of Moonstone type items
Decreased the drop rate of Star Fragments
Increased the drop rate of Ergo items
Increased the Ergo rewards of certain monsters that appear after Lorenzini Arcade"

Boss Monster Balance Changes

Decreased the HP of 'Simon Manus, Arm of God'
Decreased the damage of 'Simon Manus, Awakened God'

Increased the Specter's HP and damage

System Changes Related to the Character Progression Reset

Added the feature to reset the character's level, P-Organ, and Legion Arms at the 'Gold Coin Tree'
Characters created after this patch will now receive 8 Gold Coin Fruits instead of 5 for their first harvest
Adjusted the required amount of gold coins to reset the character's level, P-Organ, and Legion Arms

Lies of P's Update 1.2.0.0 also features a few bug fixes as well: 

Fixed a bug with the Legion Arm 'Pandemonium II - Acid Charge' rarely not working properly.

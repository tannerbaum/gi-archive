  Possessor(s) Is A Side-Scrolling Action Game From The Devs Behind Hyper Light Drifter And Solar Ash 






            Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed Possessor(s), a side-scrolling action game coming to consoles and PC next year. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. 

In Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an "open-ended world structure" as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). 

"Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat," a press release for Possessor(s) reads. "Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses."

Throughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. 

Here are some Possessor(s) screenshots: 

Possessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine's other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year.

  FragPunk Is A 5v5 Hero Shooter Built Around Cards And First-Person Action






            NetEase has revealed FragPunk, a new 5v5 hero shooter coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime next year. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, FragPunk features stylized art, squad-based first-person combat, and more than 70 cards to power up your arsenal of moves. 

"FragPunk is a frantic, squad-based, 5v5 hero shooter where you set the rules of engagement for every new round by activating power-up cards," an Xbox Wire post reads. "With its debut at Xbox Games Showcase 2024, FragPunk rocks the hero shooter genre with fast-paced combat and a plethora of synergies and counterplays between over 70 shard cards, 10 heroes, 14 weapons, and 4 maps."

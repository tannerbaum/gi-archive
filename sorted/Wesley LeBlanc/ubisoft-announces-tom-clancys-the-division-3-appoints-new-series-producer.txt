  Ubisoft Announces Tom Clancy's The Division 3, Appoints New Series Producer 






            Ubisoft has announced Tom Clancy's The Division 3 and Massive Entertainment, the Sweden-based company behind the first two Division games and the upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, is developing it. The studio announced this in a new post on Twitter today, linking to a blog discussing the threequel. In it, Ubisoft reveals that Star Wars Outlaws creative director Julian Gerighty will take over as The Division brand's executive producer once Outlaws ships.Â 

Gerighty joined The Division team as an associate creative director in 2014. After Massive shipped the first Division game, Gerighty moved onto Tom Clancy's The Division 2 as creative director. As executive producer of the brand, Gerighty will work on The Division 3 and other projects set in The Division universe like Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence on mobile and the survival-action shooter, Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland.Â 

Julian Gerighty has been appointed Executive Producer for the Tom Clancyâ€™s The Division brand. Julian will oversee all games and products, including Tom Clancyâ€™s The Division 3, led by Massive Entertainment who is actively building a team for the game.

Ubisoft says The Division 2 will remain "well supported" even while Massive works on The Division 3.Â 

"We may have over 40 million players, but The Division is still in its early years as a franchise," Gerighty writes in the Ubisoft blog. "There are so many incredible stories to tell, places to explore, and people to protect.Â 

"I think that we delivered that with Tom Clancy's The Division's cutting-edge visuals, incredible gameplay, and promise to the player that they can't get this experience anywhere else, and then again with Tom Clancy's The Division 2. It's about refinement, it's about pushing the quality bar consistently forward."Â 

Gerighty will remain on Star Wars Outlaws until it launches sometime next year.Â

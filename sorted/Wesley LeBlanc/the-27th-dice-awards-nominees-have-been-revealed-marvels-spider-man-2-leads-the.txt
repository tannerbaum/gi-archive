  The 27th DICE Awards Nominees Have Been Revealed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Leads The Pack






            The 27th D.I.C.E. Awards return next month to Las Vegas, where the industry-only event celebrates the best games and achievements in games of 2023. Unlike The Game Awards, which are hosted and produced by Geoff Keighley, with votes from media outlets and the public in some instances, the D.I.C.E Awards are voted on exclusively by game developers. 

Basically, it's the awards show where the people who made the games you played last year determine their favorite games of last year. It's an awards show of The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, with D.I.C.E standing for Design, Innovate, Communicate, and Entertain, and amongst the awards, the academy typically inducts someone into the Academy of Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame – we spoke to Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon about it in 2022. 

Like in previous years, Kinda Funny's Greg Miller and IGN's Stella Chung will host the show, which will be livestreamed on Thursday, February 15, 2024.

As you might know, 2023 was a great year for games (but an admittedly terrible one for the people who make them with more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry). Leading the pack of the 27th annual D.I.C.E. Awards is Marvel's Spider-Man 2, developed by Insomniac Games, with nine nominations. Following it is Remedy Entertainment's Alan Wake 2, with eight nominations. And behind it is Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3, with seven nominations.

  The Last Of Us Game's Tess Actor, Annie Wersching, Dies At 45






            The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, AnnieÂ Wersching,Â has died. She was 45.Â 

WerschingÂ was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family.Â 

In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles inÂ 24Â andÂ Bosch, as reported byÂ Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann.Â 

"I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family."Â

Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, andÂ VarietyÂ reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode ofÂ Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows likeÂ Frasier,Â Supernatural, andÂ Charmed, before she received recurring roles inÂ General HospitalÂ andÂ 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of UsÂ over the past two few weeks.Â

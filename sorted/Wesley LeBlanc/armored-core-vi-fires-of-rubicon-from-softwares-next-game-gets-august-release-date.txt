  Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon, From Software's Next Game, Gets August Release Date






            From Software, the developer behind last year's critically acclaimed Elden Ring, announced Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards 2022. Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it's probably sooner than you expected. 

That's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. 

Check out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: 

As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. 

The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: 

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.

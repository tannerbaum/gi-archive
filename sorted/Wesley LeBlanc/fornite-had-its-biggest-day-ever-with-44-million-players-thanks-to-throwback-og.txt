  Fornite Had Its Biggest Day Ever With 44 Million Players Thanks To Throwback OG Season






            Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day everÂ again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4.Â 

Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite's history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.

Way to start things off with a big bang ðŸ’¥

We're blown away by the response to #FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortniteâ€™s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.

To all Fortnite players, OG and new, THANK YOU!

As for why, Epic doesn't list a specific reason but it's pretty clear it's because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X.Â

  The Cut Content Included In The Last Of Us Part II Remastered | New Gameplay Today






            Developer Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Part II hit PlayStation 4 in 2020, and now, four years later, The Last of Us Part II Remastered is just a few days away from its fancy new PlayStation 5 release. More specifically, it hits PS5 this Friday, January 19. We've played the game, and you can read some impressions from a first-time player of the game's story here, and you can read about how I think HBO's adaptation can fix the worst part of The Last of Us Part II. 

But if you're looking for some gameplay, we have a New Gameplay Today of the remaster's new roguelite mode, No Return, you can view here. However, The Last of Us Part II Remastered also features three "Lost Levels" that were parts of the original game cut during development. In our latest New Gameplay Today, Kyle Hilliard and myself play through these three cut levels and discuss how they might have flowed if kept in the game.

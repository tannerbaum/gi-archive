  PlayStation Unveils Limited Edition Astro Bot DualSense Controller






            PlayStation has unveiled a limited edition Astro Bot DualSense controller for the PlayStation 5, and it launches September 6, the same day developer Team Asobi's Astro Bot launches. Preorders begin on Friday, August 9, at 7 a.m PT/10 a.m. ET in the U.S. and the controller will cost $79.99. 

"The controller's design features Astro's signature blue accents on the handles and buttons, carved in, sci-fi lines as well as the trademark playful pair of eyes on the touch pad," a PlayStation Blog post reads. 

As you can see, this limited edition controller looks a lot like the titular Astro Bot, and will pair nicely with the game when it launches September 6.

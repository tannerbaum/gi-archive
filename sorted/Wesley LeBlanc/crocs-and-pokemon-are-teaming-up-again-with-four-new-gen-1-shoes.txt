  Crocs And Pokémon Are Teaming Up Again With Four New Gen 1 Shoes






            Crocs and Pokémon are teaming up again for another collaboration, this time bringing four classic Generation 1 pocket monsters into the shoe line sometime this year. This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 

Though there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place.

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers.

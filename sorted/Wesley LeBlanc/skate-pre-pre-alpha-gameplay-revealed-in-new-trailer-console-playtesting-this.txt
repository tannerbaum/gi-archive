  Skate: 'Pre-Pre-Alpha' Gameplay Revealed In New Trailer, Console Playtesting This Fall






            Publisher EA and developer Full Circle have released a new trailer for their long-in-development Skate, the fourth mainline entry in the Skate series and the first in more than a decade. Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, EA announced with the trailer that "console playtesting" for the game will begin this fall; there's still no release date for the game, though. 

In the trailer, which begins with a live-action segment starring comedian Tim Robinson (who actually shreds in real life, by the way), we see him as an employee of the fictional M-Corp before transitioning to a look at pre-pre-alpha gameplay of Skate. The gameplay admittedly looks early, but players can check it out on console this fall when "console playtesting" begins. 

Check it out in the Skate. trailer for yourself below: 

EA announced in 2020 that it was working on a new Skate game, and we later learned it will be called "Skate." instead of Skate 4 like many presumed. We also learned in 2022 that it will be a free-to-play title as well.

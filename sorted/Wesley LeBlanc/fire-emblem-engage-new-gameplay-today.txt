  Fire Emblem Engage | New Gameplay Today






            Your hosts, Wesley LeBlanc and Brian Shea, have played Fire Emblem Engage, and in today's New Gameplay Today, the two discuss their thoughts on it thus far. The two talk about their feelings on the game's combat, how it's similar and different to prior entries, the story and characters, and why it's absurd that you can't pet the dogs you can adopt in it. Enjoy!

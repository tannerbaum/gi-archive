  Fallout 76's Skyline Valley Launches Next Week, Play As A Ghoul Starting In 2025






            The next expansion for Fallout 76 is called Skyline Valley and it launches next week. More specifically, Skyline Valley expands the game's map southward to the all-new Shenandoah region on June 12. 

There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too. 

Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below: 

As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.

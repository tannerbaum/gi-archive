  Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth Is Annapurna Interactive's First In-House Game






            Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. 

Annapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. 

Not much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: 

As you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. 

Annapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon.

  Nike And Tekken 8 Are Tag-Teaming Up For Foamposite One Shoe Collaboration






            Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 

The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue.

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 

Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 

These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

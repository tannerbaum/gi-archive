  Retailer Listing Of A 'V2 DualSense' With 12-Hour Battery Life For PS5 Spotted Online






            A retailer listing of a "V2 DualSense" controller for the PlayStation 5 has been spotted online, and it boasts an "exceptional" 12-hour battery life. That's a much longer battery life than the standard version of the DualSense controller, which averages between 6 to 10 hours (and many players would argue less). 

More specifically, players spotted a Best Buy Canada retail listing for a "PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller – White," as reported by Eurogamer. Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the "About This Product" section of the controller, you'll find, "Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions." This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that "offers easy click-in charging." 

Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it's real, and will update this story if it learns more.

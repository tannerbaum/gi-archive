  Bokeh Game Studio Shows Early Slitterhead Footage






            In 2020, we learned that Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of Silent Hill, had opened Bokeh Game Studio to develop a new horror game. The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. 

Most of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 

Check it out for yourself: 

As you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: 

In 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game.

  PlayStation Reveals Lego Horizon Adventures, Coming To PS5, Switch, And PC This Holiday






            PlayStation has revealed Lego Horizon Adventures, a Lego brick version of Guerrilla Games' hit Horizon series. Like Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy returns in Lego Horizon Adventures as the protagonist of the exploration-based adventure game. It's releasing simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this holiday. 

Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Lego Horizon Adventures seems to take the fun, action, and robot dinosaurs of the Horizon series and turn it all into bricks (literally). However, instead of world-ending threats, Lego Horizon Adventures has a much more comedic and tongue-in-cheek vibe to Aloy's journey, with an emphasis on two-player co-op action. It's being developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo. 

Check it out for yourself in the Lego Horizon Adventures reveal trailer below: 

News of Lego Horizon Adventures launching simultaneously on PS5, Switch, and PC might come as a surprise given PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst, who coincidentally used to lead Horizon developer Guerrilla Games, recently said live-service games will launch day and date on PC while its tentpole single-player releases won't.

However, given Lego Horizon Adventures features co-op, it falls somewhere in between those categories. It's not a live-service game, and while it is spin-off in one of PlayStation's tentpole series, it isn't a tentpole single-player release. But, given the game's lean into co-op elements, it makes sense that PlayStation is giving it the simultaneous-platform release like it did with Helldivers 2 and the upcoming Concord. Games that fall outside of that category include Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, which recently launched on PC years after the PlayStation 5 release, and God of War Ragnarök, which PlayStation recently announced is launching on PC this September. 

Lego Horizon Adventure hits PS5, Switch, and PC this holiday season.

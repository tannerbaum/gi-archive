  Ninja Theory Showcases Impressive Facial Animation In New Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Teaser






            Ninja Theory revealed Senua's Saga: Hellblade II during The Game Awards back in 2019 and while that initial trailer impressed us with its dark tone and beautiful visuals, not much else has been released about the game. Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 

Now, thanks to today's State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic's Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what's to come in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it's a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 

Check out this new Senua's Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below:

As you can see, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don't know when we'll be playing the game, though.

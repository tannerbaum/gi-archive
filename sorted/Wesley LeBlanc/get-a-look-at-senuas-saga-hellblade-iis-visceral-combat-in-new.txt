  Get A Look At Senua's Saga: Hellblade II's Visceral Combat In New Gameplay Trailer






            Developer Ninja Theory made another appearance at The Game Awards, this time with a new trailer for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. In the trailer, we get confirmation that it's still expected to hit Xbox Series X/S in 2024 alongside a new look at its extremely visceral combat. 

Like previous Hellblade II trailers, we see Senua trudging through some dangerous wilderness. She's not fighting giant monsters this time, though, as instead, she's up against more human-sized enemies. And this trailer gives us the most in-depth look at Hellblade II's combat yet – unsurprisingly, it looks great (and gruesomely realistic). 

Check it out for yourself in the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay trailer below: 

"The sequel to the award winning Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice sees Senua return in a brutal journey of survival through the myth and torment of Viking Iceland," the trailer's description reads. "Intent on saving those who have fallen victim to the horrors of tyranny, Senua faces a battle of overcoming darkness within and without."

Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

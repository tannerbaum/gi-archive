  Game Boy Advance Version Of Fire Emblem Hits Nintendo Switch Online Next Week






            The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. 

More specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. 

A prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. 

Fire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage.

  Netflix Reveals First Look At Devil May Cry Anime From Castlevania Producer Adi Shankar






            Netflix has revealed the first look at its Devil May Cry anime series coming to the subscription streaming service soon. First announced in 2018, it is being developed by Capcom, Studio Mir, and Netflix's Castlevania executive producer Adi Shankar. 

Netflix announced this anime today with a short teaser trailer that gives us our first look at its Dante, who is, of course, escaping a would-be death by sword while firing off bullets from his two trademark pistols. The short snippets of animation we see in the teaser look great, just like Netflix's Castlevania series and its upcoming Castlevania: Nocturne anime, and you can check it out for yourself below: 

Netflix revealed little else about the show although it did call today's teaser a "SSStylish first look." There is no release date for Netflix's Devil May Cry but Netflix says it's coming soon. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer's Devil May Cry 5 review and then watch this trailer for Netflix's Castlevania: Nocturne after that.

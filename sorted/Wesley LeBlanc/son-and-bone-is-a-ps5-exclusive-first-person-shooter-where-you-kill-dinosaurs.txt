  Son And Bone Is A PS5 Exclusive First-Person Shooter Where You Kill Dinosaurs 






            TeamKill Media, the developer behind last year's Quantum Error, has revealed Son and Bone, its PlayStation 5-exclusive first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. It's due out some time this year and you can watch the announcement teaser below. 

"When a local farm in Patchwork, MT is attacked by a group of notorious bandits, Sheriff Sam Judge sets out to bring them to justice by any means necessary and save the hostage they have taken," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "But on his journey, through the mysterious motives of those he pursues, Sam finds himself transported to another world overrun with prehistoric creatures and dinosaurs and must fight for his life to make it back to earth."

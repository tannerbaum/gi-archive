  Netflix's Live Action One Piece Show Coming This Year






            Netflix's live action One Piece series will set sail this year. 

The subscription streaming service revealed this news today with a new image and a poster for the upcoming pirate series based on the long-running (and extremely popular) manga and anime series, One Piece. The release year image features Monkey D. Luffy, played by Iñaki Godoy, raising his fist up in the air. You can see Netflix's One Piece logo in the image below as well:

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar's Sanji, Emily Rudd's Nami, Godoy's Luffy, Jacob Gibson's Usopp, and Mackenyu's Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew's ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 

While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven't seen Netflix's One Piece show in motion so here's hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. 

While waiting for more, read Game Informer's review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG.

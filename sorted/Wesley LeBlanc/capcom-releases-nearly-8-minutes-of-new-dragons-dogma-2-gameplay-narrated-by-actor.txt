  Capcom Releases Nearly 8 Minutes Of New Dragon's Dogma 2 Gameplay Narrated By Actor Ian McShane






            Dragon's Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game's launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it's narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 

Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses "The Hero" of Dragon's Dogma 2, the "Two Nations," and, of course, "The Monsters" that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 

Check it out for yourself in the Dragon's Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below:

  Far Cry 6, SteamWorld Build, and Both Remnant Games Head To Game Pass This Month






            The month of December brings many things: cold weather, the holiday season, and this year, a new crop of games on Xbox Game Pass. Highlights this month include Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant II, giving subscribers a chance to try out both games if they haven't yet. It also gives them day one access to SteamWorld Build, the latest in the genre-shifting SteamWorld series. And for fans of big-budget open-world adventure games, subscribers will also get access to the latest entry in the Far Cry series. Below is the full list, their dates, and our reviews.

What's Coming To Game Pass Core?

Earlier this year, Xbox replaced Xbox Live Gold with Xbox Game Pass Core. It's a scaled-down console-specific version of Game Pass that allows players to play online and get access to certain discounts, but instead of Gold's two free games a month, Game Pass Core members get access to a smaller list of games from the full Game Pass library. There are currently 36 games available. This month, that roster expands by two.

Chivalry 2 – December 6

Totally Reliable Delivery Service – December 6

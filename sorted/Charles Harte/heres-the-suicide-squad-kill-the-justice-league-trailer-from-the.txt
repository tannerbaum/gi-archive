  Here's The Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League Trailer From The Game Awards






            Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been in development for a long time; by the time it comes out next year, it will have been nine years since Rocksteady's last game. But after years of secret development and repeated delays, it's finally around the corner, and The Game Awards just gave us our latest look. See for yourself in the trailer below:

The notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).

Luckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.

But the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.

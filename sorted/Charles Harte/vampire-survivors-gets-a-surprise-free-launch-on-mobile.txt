Vampire Survivors is an indie roguelike RPG where the player has to avoid hordes of monsters, undead, and (you guessed it) vampires. As you destroy enemies, you progress through a randomized skill tree to unlock new weapons and abilities. To get a better idea of the game, you can read our review, where we called it a “Single-Stick Masterpiece.”

In other Vampire Survivor news, earlier this week developer Poncle announced DLC called Legacy of the Moonspell. It comes with eight new survivors, thirteen new weapons, six new music tracks, new monsters, and a new stage, which they’ve called their biggest yet. It comes out soon, on December 15.

  Pedro Pascal Stars In Mysterious New Merge Mansion Short






            Between The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, and a viral TikTok audio, Pedro Pascal has been on a roll this month. Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:

In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.

In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.

“Merge Mansion has created a fascinating story centered around family drama filled with mystery and secrets that has captivated fans all around the world through their entertaining and unpredictable video campaigns. Making this short film for Merge Mansion was truly a unique experience and I had so much fun working with Martin to fulfill his vision and bring the lore of Merge Mansion to life. From the first day, it was clear how much love and passion the group at Metacore has for its characters and this game and I’m happy that I got to be a part of their next big moment.” 

What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.

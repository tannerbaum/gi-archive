  Check Out The Next Game From The Devs Of Untitled Goose Game






            Untitled Goose Game was one of the most viral indie games when it launched in 2019. It was simple and fun, overflowing with charm and personality. It seems like developer House House has some of that personality left in the tank, because their next game, Big Walk, looks incredibly intriguing. Check out the reveal trailer below,

In Big Walk, you and your friends will explore an open world full of puzzles and things to discover. According to the Steam page, you'll need to figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless. This explains why, in the trailer, we see lots of attempts at communication, from waving arms to holding up certain images.

The aforementioned Steam listing also says "Sit and watch the sunset, or steal your friendâ€™s binoculars and kick them into the ocean." It seems that much like Goose Game, there will be plenty of time for shenanigans. You'll be able to check it out in 2025.

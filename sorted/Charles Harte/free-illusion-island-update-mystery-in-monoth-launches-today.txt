  Free Illusion Island Update, Mystery In Monoth, Launches Today






            Disney Illusion Island was one of our favorite platformers from last year, thanks to its charming visuals, engaging combat-free design, and toe-tapping soundtrack. If you haven't checked it out yet, today is a great day to do so, thanks to the free update that adds a brand-new chapter of gameplay.

Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.

You can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.

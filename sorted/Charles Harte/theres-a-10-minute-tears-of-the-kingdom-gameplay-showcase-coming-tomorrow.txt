Despite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.

We'll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer's Twitch channel.

  Usual June Is The Latest From Finji






            Finji, a studio known for its work on Indie hits like Tunic and Chicory, announced its latest project at The Game Awards today. It's called Usual June, and it tells the story of a girl struggling to balance her summer break with saving the universe. You can watch the reveal trailer below.

Even after watching the trailer, you might not have much of an idea of what the game is about; it's pretty scarce when it comes to concrete information. We see the protagonist (fittingly named June) as she hacks and slashes her way through spectral creatures in a mysterious world. Luckily, the Steam listing for the game provides some context to her actions. Here's a bit of what the developer has to say about the game:

Follow June and her new besties (alive and dead) as they investigate the town’s century-spanning secret history, explore a shattered multi-dimensional continuum, chill at the cemetery, defend themselves against massive monsters from beyond the pale, and deflect their parents’ questions about what they’re doing after they graduate.

 It sounds like it'll be telling a typical coming-of-age story mashed up with supernatural heroics. In between story beats, players will also be able to experience some "frantic, flexible combat." We'll be able to get a taste of that ourselves when the game drops some time in 2025.

  Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector Announced






            After learning that the Citizen Sleeper team had another game in the works, we were excited to try whatever came next, whenever that was. Today's PC Gaming Show gave us an exciting update, and much sooner than we might have expected: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is currently in development.

The sequel takes place in the same world as the last, "some time" after the events Citizen Sleeper. As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.

If this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it "a game I'll be thinking about for years to come." It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.

  The First Descendant Gets A Full Release Next Summer






            The First Descendant is a free-to-play looter shooter from Nexon. There have been beta sessions before now, but the game is getting a full, proper launch next Summer. The exact date is up in the air still, but according to a blog post from the developers, it will be announced as soon as they can pin it down. Check out the latest trailer below.

In The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants â€“ a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets. Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.

There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.

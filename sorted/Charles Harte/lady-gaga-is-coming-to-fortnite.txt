  Lady Gaga Is Coming To Fortnite






            We've reached a point as a society where it feels like it's only a matter of time before your favorite celebrity gets added to Fortnite. When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says "Fortnite Festival," implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.

The funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, "what is fortnight," either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.

Fortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it's getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney. To learn more about its musical mode specifically, check out our interview with the head of Harmonix, the team behind Fortnite Festival.

  After 15 Years, Visions Of Mana Revives The Series






            While they may have been tided over by recent remakes and re-releases, fans of the Mana series have gone a whopping 15 years without a taste of a new mainline entry. Luckily for them, the fast is over; Visions Of Mana was just announced at The Game Awards, and it's out next year. Check out the reveal trailer below.

Square Enix has more details on their website. "Once every four years," it reads, "The Faerie visits regions of the world to choose alms - people who are fated to travel to the Tree of Mana, which presides over the world’s vital flow of mana. Val invites his childhood friend to a festival to welcome the visitor, but as the night falls, the sky lights up with sparkling lights and the Faerie chooses her as the alm."

The game will also feature "a vibrant semi-open 3D field," though it's unclear exactly what that will look like in game. We can at least be certain it will have plenty of enemies (including series staple Rabites), and you'll be able to battle them using fast-paced, real-time combat. The wait will be over soon – Visions of Mana is out next year.

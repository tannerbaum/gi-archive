  Stellar Blade Gets A Free Demo This Friday






            Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn't officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game's opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.

Game director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, "This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story."

Stellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January's State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.

Stellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.

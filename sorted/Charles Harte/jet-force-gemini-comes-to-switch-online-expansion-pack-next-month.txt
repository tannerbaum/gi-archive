  Jet Force Gemini Comes To Switch Online Expansion Pack Next Month






            Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online's highest tier, the expansion pack, have access to an ever-growing catalog of modern and classic games, including a small library of N64 games. In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.

First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.

The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.Â  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.

The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.

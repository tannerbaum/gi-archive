  Pokémon Returns To Kalos With Legends: Z-A in 2025






            During today's Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.

Check out some images from the trailer below:

The teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words "urban redevelopment plan." This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

Other than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called "a worthwhile spin-off adventure."

  XDefiant | New Gameplay Today






            Join Charles Harte and Alex Van Aken as they dissect preview footage of XDefiant, Ubisoft's upcoming free-to-play shooter. For the uninitiated, XDefiant's defining mechanic is the factions system, which allows players to gain abilities from some of Ubisoft's most popular shooters, like Far Cry, Splinter Cell, and Watch Dogs. Our impressions from the event were positive, but you can judge for yourself by watching our gameplay clip below.

For more information on the game and how it feels to play, check out our preview. XDefiant's closed beta starts today, April 13.

For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Sea of Stars, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Exoprimal, Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Final Fantasy XVI, and more.

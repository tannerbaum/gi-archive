  Ubisoft's Open-World Star Wars Game Is Out Next Year






            Today during the Xbox Showcase, we finally got a look at the open-world Star Wars game Ubisoft has been working on for the last few years. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.

The description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.

"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi," the description says. "Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most wanted."

While the new title isn't out until 2024, we'll be learning more about it at Ubisoft's showcase tomorrow. For the full lineup of showcases this month, check out our streaming schedule.

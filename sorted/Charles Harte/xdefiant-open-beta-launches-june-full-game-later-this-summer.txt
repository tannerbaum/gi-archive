  XDefiant Open Beta Launches June, Full Game Later This Summer






            After a series of closed beta periods, XDefiant is ready for public testing. Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 

XDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.

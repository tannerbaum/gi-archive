  Crytek's Hunt: Showdown Now Available On Xbox Game Preview 






Those excited for Crytek's Hunt: Showdown no longer have to wait. Following its recent announcement that the game will be made available in Spring 2019, Hunt: Showdown has been released on Xbox Game Preview for $30. Crytek announced their partnership with Microsoft last summer, and aim to use Game Preview to involve the community in the game's development.

"We continue to want Hunt: Showdown’s development to be community-driven, and an Xbox Game Preview release allows us to base further development work on community feedback as we test and refine new features, equipment, cast and settings," wrote Crytek producer Fatih Özbayram on Xbox Wire. "The dialogue between the Hunt community and Hunt developers will be important in creating a fun experience."

While the game is still a work-in-progress, Xbox Game Preview allows players to play it in its current state with regular updates leading to the game's eventual release. 

Hunt: Showdown is a multiplayer first-person shooter set in Louisiana, where the player must collect bounties on creatures and monsters across the countryside. Once you bag your prize, however, you become the hunted as other players try to steal your bounty. For more on Hunt: Showdown, here are five reasons why it could be the next big survival hit.

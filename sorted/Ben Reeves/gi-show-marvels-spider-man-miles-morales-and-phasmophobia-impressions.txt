  GI Show – Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales And Phasmophobia Impressions






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including: Phasmophobia, Torchlight III, Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Then we take a deep dive into Game Informer's newest cover story on Insomniac's upcoming Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Finally, we close the show with another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Andrew Reiner, Matt Miller, Kim Wallace, Dan Tack, Blake Hester, Alex Stadnik, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!

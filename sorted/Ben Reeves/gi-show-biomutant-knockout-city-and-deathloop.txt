  GI Show – Biomutant, Knockout City, And Deathloop Interview






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Biomutant, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Knockout City, and Portal Reloaded. We close the show by interviewing Arkane Studios' game director Dinga Bakaba (@DBakaba) and art director Sébastien Mitton (@mitmitman) about their newest project Deathloop and why they didn't just make another Dishonored. 

It's a full show, but we make time for another round of fantastic community emails. So please join Brian Shea (@BrianPShea), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for a new wild and ever-entertaining episode!

  We Break Down The Highlights From Microsoft's Xbox Showcase






Microsoft recently showed off Halo: Infinite and a new Fable during its recent Xbox Showcase, and we're here to talk about all the highs and lows of the show. Join Jeff Cork, Joe Juba, Alex Stadnik, and myself for a slightly loopy conversation. What did we think about Obsidian's new RPG, Avowed? How do we feel about getting another State of Decay? Are we excited to see Jack Black in Psychonauts 2? You'll have to listen to the show and find out.

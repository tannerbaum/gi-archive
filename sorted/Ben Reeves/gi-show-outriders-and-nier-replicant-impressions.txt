  GI Show – Outriders And Nier Replicant Impressions






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Outriders, Nier Replicant Ver.1.22474487139…, Lost Words: Beyond the Page, Oddworld: Soulstorm, Sea of Thieves, and Cozy Grove. We're also joined by Andrew Borman (@Borman18) from the Strong Museum of Play who talks about the institution's efforts to preserve gaming history and how he became a video game historian.

It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), Alex Van Aken (@itsVanAken), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Jason Guisao (@Jason_Guisao), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!

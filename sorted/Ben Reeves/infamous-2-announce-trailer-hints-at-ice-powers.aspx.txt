  Infamous 2 Announce Trailer Hints At Ice Powers






You may have seen Sony’s electrifying Infamous 2 trailer during E3, but now we’ve got the goods online. Feel free to watch it on repeat.
Those of us with eyes may notice that the trailer seems to hint that Infamous 2 hero, Cole, may start to develop ice powers at some point in the sequel. Can anyone else think of another explanation? Regardless, the trailer makes us wish we had ice powers and could cryogenically freeze ourselves until the game’s release in 2011.

  GI Show – Starfield, Guardians Of The Galaxy, And E3 Day 2 Recap






            We interrupt your normally scheduled podcast to talk about anything and everything that happened during day two of E3 2021, which includes Starfield, Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, Back 4 Blood, Battlefield 2042, The Outer Worlds 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins, and much much more. 

Join Alex Stadnik, Blake Hester, Marcus Stewart, Liana Ruppert, and Ben Reeves for another wet and wild episode. Sure, we talked in detail about Battlefield 2024, but there is so much more to talk about. And now that we know what else Gearbox has been working on with Tiny Tina back into the spotlight? This week's podcast is one you're not going to want to miss.

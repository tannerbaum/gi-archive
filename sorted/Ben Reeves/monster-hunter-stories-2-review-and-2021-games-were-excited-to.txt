  Monster Hunter Stories 2 Review And 2021 Games We're Excited to Play – GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of games we've been digging recently, including Griftlands, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, Shape of the World, Oxenfree, and more. After talking about what we've been enjoying, we then spend a good part of the show talking about the games we're most excited to play for the rest of the year, including Metroid Dread, Battlefield 2042, Back 4 Blood, and Halo Infinite.

It's a full show, but we make time for another round of fantastic community emails. So please join John Carson (@John_Carson), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Alex Van Aken (@itsVanAken), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for a new wild and ever-entertaining episode!

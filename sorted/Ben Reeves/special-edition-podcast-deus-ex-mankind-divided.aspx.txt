  Special Edition Podcast – Deus Ex: Mankind Divided






All month long we've been revealing information on the next installment in the Deus Ex franchise from Eidos Montreal. We've looked at the series past, we've explained how the studio creates a believable future, and we've explained why people get augmented in the first place. As a way to patch any holes in this extensive coverage, we turned things over to the community for any questions about this exciting new title and then spoke with game director Jean-Francois Dugas and asked them dozens of your burning questions.

Listen to the podcast below to learn more about Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's gameplay, why Eidos-Montreal has moved the action to Prague, and whether or not you can expect to download some mods for the game when it releases.

Visit our Deus Ex hub page for exclusive video interviews with the team, bonus features, a special-edition podcast, and more.

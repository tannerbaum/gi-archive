  New Gran Turismo 7 Trailer Shows Off Customization And Photo Mode

Release
March 4, 2022

            Amidst the Marvel takeover during today's Showcase event, Sony showed off Polyphony Digital's realist racing game, giving fans a tease of what to expect with the newest installment. The GT series has always focused on realistic racing and presenting a large stable of cars focusing on even the smallest minutia. 

In the newest trailer, we got a look at car customization features, GT 7's photo mode, globe-spanning race tracks, and weather effects. 

Gran Turismo 7 initially looked set as a PS5 exclusive that could be out before the end of this year. However, in June, Sony revealed that the title would not release until 2022, thanks to delays resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Thankfully, Gran Turismo 7 is also set to release on PS4 and PS4 Pro.

It's been over eight years since the release of the last numbered Gran Turismo, so this could be a big deal. In our review for GT 6, Matthew Kato said, "It's fitting that GT 6 appears at the end of the PS3's arc. This 15-year anniversary is an unironic celebration of the yoke of its legacy, but it doesn't have to signal the end of the franchise itself. Thankfully, glimmers of Gran Turismo's racing spirit still live." So hopefully GT 7 has a bit more to offer. 

What do you think about Gran Turismo 7? Are you into this kind of deep customization, or do you prefer the wild playfulness in racing games like Forza Horizon?

  March Cover Revealed – Rise Of The Tomb Raider






Nearly two years ago, Crystal Dynamics released Tomb Raider, a gritty survival reboot for the iconic action series. The game was met with monumental success and became the best-selling entry in the series to date. Now the team at Crystal Dynamics is back to expand on Lara's new direction. After the events on Yamatai, the young archeologist has grown into a capable adventure seeker, and Rise of the Tomb Raider will send Lara to the frozen wilds of Siberia on a hunt for the lost secrets of immortality. Now Lara will have to hunt and craft new survival gear in order to take on larger puzzle tombs and a deadly new enemy, a secret society that has been lying in the shadows since the last game. Lara will gear up for her new adventure on Xbox One and Xbox 360 this holiday season, but the studio hasn't ruled out the possibility that the game will come to other consoles later on.

And here's a closer look at Lara Croft's new look for the game. (Click on the image to expand.)
In addition to our 12-page look at Rise of the Tomb Raider, we also 
dive into Studio MDHR’s love letter to 1930s animation classics with a 
feature on the indie darling Cuphead. We also give a rundown of our 
three-hour hands-on session with CD Projekt RED's massive open-world 
undertaking, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which looks like it could give Dragon Age: Inquisition
 a run for its money. Meanwhile, our classic section celebrates the 20th
 anniversary of the fan-favorite shooter, Star Wars: Dark Forces.
The rest of our March issue is packed with more great gaming coverage. In addition to our standard previews section, we have a special feature looking forward to the hottest games of the year, such as Batman: Arkham Knight, Evolve, Battleborn, Bloodborne, and Halo 5: Guardians. We also have the world's first exclusive review for The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D.
Print subscribers should see their issues arriving in the next week or two, but it will be available online later today if you subscribe digitally (available on PC/Mac, iPad,Android, and Google Play).

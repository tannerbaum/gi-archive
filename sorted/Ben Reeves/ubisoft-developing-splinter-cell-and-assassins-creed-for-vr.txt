  Ubisoft Developing Splinter Cell And Assassin’s Creed For VR






            During Facebook’s recent Connect conference, Ubisoft announced that it is working to bring both the Splinter Cell and Assassin’s Creed franchises into virtual reality with two brand-new games designed specifically for Oculus devices.

The development of these two new titles is being led by Ubisoft’s Red Storm in collaboration with Ubisoft Reflections, Ubisoft Dusseldorf, and Ubisoft Mumbai. Sadly, that’s all we know about these two exciting projects at the moment, but hopefully, we’ll learn more soon.

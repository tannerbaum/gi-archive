  Death Stranding's Baby 'Explained'






At Gamescom, we got a sneak peek into what is sure to be one of the PlayStation 4's big holiday titles. Kojima got a stranding ovation when he took the stage to show off several new characters, and these characters help explain the role of babies in the game.

The first character we got a look at was Mama, who is played by Margaret Qualley. This characters seems to be some kind of mechanic who has an invisible baby. What else do you need to know? Her baby was born on the "other side," but they are still connected through an umbilical cord. In the world of Death Stranding, babies seem to be connectedÂ to the afterlife and are capable of creating a link between the two realities.

The second character we saw was Bridge Baby (shortened as BB). This is the baby that Sam (Norman Reedus) carries around with him. Sadly, BB's mom died when he was born, which means that the baby is connected to the world of the dead. This is how Sam is able sense other creatures on the "other side." I'm sure we don't have to explain the finer points of how this works, considering its pretty obvious.

Death Stranding hits the PS4 on November 8, but we should see a lot more next month at TGS.

  GI Show - Avengers, Superhot: Mind Control Delete, And Grounded






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we share our early impressions on the recent Avengers war table, Grounded's early access, and Superhot expansion Mind Control Delete. Then we try a new segment call Game Informer's Meaningless Character Rankings. As the name implies, it's meaningless, but it's going to catch on. Finally, we close out the show with a round of community emails. So please join Jeff Cork, Brian Shea, Alex Stadnik, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!

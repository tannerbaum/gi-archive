  Resident Evil Village Spoilercast: The Biggest Twists And Surprises






            Resident Evil Village is one of the biggest games of the year, and in many ways it doesn't disappoint, but it's not without its flaws either. Several Game Informer editors, including Dan Tack (@dantack), Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) all sit down to talk about those highs, lows, and all the surprising twists in-between. On this show, we're also joined by freelancer Suriel Vazquez (@SurielVazquez), who offers some valuable insights. 

We want to emphasize that we SPOIL everything about this game including the boss fights, Chris' role, and the post credit scene. If you haven't beat Resident Evil Village, we highly recommend you do that before you watch this video.

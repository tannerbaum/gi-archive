  M-Rated Game Sales Are On The Rise






This year saw an increase in the sale of M-rated games, which have risen 16 percent since 2009. 
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, M-rated video games made up 26 percent of the overall gaming market this year. This is a significant increase from previous years. 
Looking back it does seem like a lot of the year’s biggest titles – Red Dead: Redemption, God of War III, Mass Effect 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops, etc. – were all Mature rated titles. Is this a trend that will continue into next year, or did 2010 just have a larger number of quality M-rated titles than usual? It will be interesting to see what 2011 brings.

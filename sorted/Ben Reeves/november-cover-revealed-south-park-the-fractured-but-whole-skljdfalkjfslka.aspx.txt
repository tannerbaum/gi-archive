  November Cover Revealed – South Park: The Fractured But Whole






Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created a hit TV show, several blockbuster films, and an award-winning Broadway musical, but in 2014 the duo finally cracked the code with video games and released the critically-acclaimed South Park: The Stick of Truth. Now South Park’s creators have teamed up with Ubisoft for a sequel that looks to deliver a richer gameplay experience and a longer narrative without sacrificing any of South Park’s iconic humor. After an exclusive behind-closed-doors tour of Ubisoft San Francisco's office, we returned with a detailed look at what sets The Fractured But Whole apart from its predecessor, and why it has the potential to be one of the funniest games ever made. 
During our studio visit, we spoke with senior producer Jason Schroeder and director of design Paul Cross about how the studio has shifted its development approach to adapt to the creative whims of South Park’s creators. We also had opportunities to explore The Fractured But Whole’s extensive character creation system, discover how the last few seasons of the show affect the game, and go hands-on with the new board game-inspired battle system. You can read about all of this and more in our 14-page blowout cover story.

  GI Show – PS5 Showcase Impressions And Oculus Quest 2 Hands-On






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show we talk about a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including: Spelunky 2, Super Mario 3D All-Stars, and Avengers. We also go hands-on with Oculus' newest Quest 2 VR headset before breaking down and reacting to Sony's recent PS5 Showcase. Finally, we end the show with another fantastic round of community emails and Meaningless Character Rankings. So please join Jeff Cork, Brian Shea, Jay Guisao, Liana Ruppert, Alex Stadnik, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!

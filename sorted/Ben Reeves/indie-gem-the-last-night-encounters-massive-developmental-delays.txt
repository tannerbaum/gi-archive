  Indie Gem The Last Night Encounters Massive Developmental Delays






            We don't know much about theÂ cyberpunk platformer The Last Night, but this spiritual successor to the 1992 game Flashback made a strong first impression during its E3 2017 trailer (above). The Last Night is about a second-class citizen who becomes disheartened by the seemingly pointless existence of his neighbors who's day-to-day lives are completely gamified.

Developer Odd Tales originally plannedÂ to release The Last Night in 2018, but the team has encountered massive business, legal, and funding issues.

Then...
- We encountered massive business, legal & funding issues we can't talk about.
- We had to cancel a new trailer of The Last Night at The Game Awards ðŸ˜°
- We're currently raising funds, so get in touch: hello@oddtales.net

The Last Night looks cool, so we hope that Odd Tales is able to find some workable solutions to its problems and deliver on its vision.

            Insomniac's Spider-Man was one of the best games of 2018 so we're beyond excited for the follow-up title Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Miles' adventure will see him growing into the role of Spider-Man. In the game, Peter Parker is out of town, leaving Miles to defend the city on his own. This is a big responsibility but one that we're sure Miles is ready to face. We'll have a lot of great stories over the course of the next month that detail how the game works and even show it in action, but to whet your appetite here is a collection of images from the game that show Miles in action.

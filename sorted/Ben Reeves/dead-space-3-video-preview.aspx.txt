  Talk About Terror: Dead Space 3 Video Preview






During E3 2012, we got pulled into a small dark room and experienced some of the horrors that Dead Space 3 offers. If our early impressions can be believed, survival horror fans have nothing to fear except Dead Space 3. 
Game Informer editors Andrew Reiner and Ben Reeves sit down to talk about how Dead Space 3 looks to deliver an honest survival horror experience. Despite the addition of co-op, the series retains a strong horror vibe.

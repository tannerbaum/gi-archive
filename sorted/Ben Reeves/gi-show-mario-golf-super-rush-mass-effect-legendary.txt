  GI Show – Mario Golf: Super Rush, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, And Resident Evil Village






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Mario Golf: Super Rush, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Biomutant, Resident Evil Village, and Knockout City. We're also joined by Fanbyte Media features editor Elise Favis (@elisefavis) and The Washington Post games reporter Gene Park (@GenePark) who talk about their time covering games together for newspapers and how that's different than working online.

It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad), Alex Van Aken (@itsVanAken), Dan Tack (@dantack), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for a new wild and ever-entertaining episode!

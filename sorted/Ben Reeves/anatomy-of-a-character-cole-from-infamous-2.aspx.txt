  Anatomy Of A Character: Cole From Infamous 2






Opinions were mixed on Cole’s design from the first Infamous, but a new setting and a few new gameplay mechanics provided Sucker Punch with the perfect opportunity to revisit the character’s look in Infamous 2. Infamous may be a franchise based on comic book sentiments, but Sucker Punch always intended Cole to be the vision of what a superhero might look like in real life, so you won’t catch him wearing a cape anytime soon. We examine how Cole’s new look in Infamous 2 suits him better.  (Note: This design isn’t final and will likely change a bit before the game’s final release.)

  Ubisoft Remakes Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time






            The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a legendary action/adventure game that made a big splash back in 2003. There series even served as a precursor to the Assassin’s Creed series. If you missed this classic adventure the first time around, you’ll be able to experience it with fresh eyes early next year.

During Ubisoft’s recent digital press conference, the publisher announced the return to this timeless classic with a remake that refreshes Sands of Time’s visuals while remaining faithful to its action and puzzle-like platforming. While the gameplay remains largely the same, the studio says that the camera, controls, and combat have been refined to match "today’s standards," so hopefully, the camera will be less finicky. Finally, much like the original game, this remake includes the original Prince of Persia PC game that originally released in 1989.

Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai are handling this remake, which is Ubisoft’s first full-scale remake. “Ubisoft heard loud and clear the desire from the players to replay their favorite game,” says Ubisoft Pune’s game director Pierre-Sylvain Gires. “The remake was made to play on the nostalgia for the old players, but we wanted also to adapt the game for the new players who didn't have the chance to play the original Sands of Time. So, alongside the graphical upgrades and sound upgrades, we also recorded new motion capture for the cinematics.”

This remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is set to release on January 21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, and will cost $39.99. Ubisoft doesn’t plan to release specific versions of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, but the game will be playable on those consoles via backwards-compatibility modes.

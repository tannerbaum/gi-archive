  Square Enix's Throwback RPG Octopath Traveler Ships Over One Million Units






Square Enix's 16-bit-inspired RPG Octopath Traveler isn't flawless, but it features a stunning tilt-shift art style, eight playable protagonists, and a genuinely fun turn-based combat system. Read our review if that sounds interesting to you.

Thankfully, this unique gem seems to be getting its due, as Nintendo of Europe recently tweeted about the title's success.

JRPGs seemed to be on the downswing for a while, so it's wonderful to see a new IP in the genre sell well. Hopefully this means Square Enix will take some time and invest in a sequel with less grinding.

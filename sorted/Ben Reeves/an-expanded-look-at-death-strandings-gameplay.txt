  An Expanded Look At Death Stranding's Gameplay






We all know that Death Stranding is part of the strand genre, but there are still a few mysteries surrounding Hideo Kojima's next title.

During the Gamescom 2019 opening presentation, we got another look at Death Stranding in action. The game is visual stunning, and the gameplay seems to involve a lot of walking through an open world where you will deliver goods and reconnect the people who live in a fractured America.

Players can scan the environment and use a variety of tools to explore/traverse an unforgiving terrain. If you fall down you might agitate the baby you carry, which would be bad. When this happens, players must cuddle and bounce the baby to make him feel better. Players will rock the baby by physically moving the PS4 controllers, using its motion controls. However, if you shake too hard the baby will get angry. And angry babies are bad!

We also got a look at another odd mechanic, which lets players pee. I'm sorry, did we say odd? We meant incredible. We don't know much about this mechanic, but it might be tied to the game's survival systems, and Kojima said that players would be able to use this pee as a weapon somehow. Additionally, if people continue to pee on the same spot in the world, "Something good will happen." We don't know what that means, but during the demo, Sam's pee made a mushroom grow.

Also, game industry journalist Geoff Keighley is an NPC in the game.

Death Stranding hits the PS4 on November 8, but we should see a lot more next month at TGS. You can watch just the gameplay above, or watch Kojima's full presentation below.

  Exploring The Full History Of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception | Video Gameography 






            After tackling Metroid in season 1 and then Halo in season 2, Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast turns its gaze to one of Sony's biggest properties: Uncharted. Now, halfway through the series, we reach one of the more divisive entries: Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.  

Developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console on November 1, 2011. After the success of Uncharted 2 and it's blockbuster setpieces, Naughty Dog upped the stakes and pushed to include even more spectacular action moments. Unfortunately, that put a toll on development. In this episode, we talk about Uncharted 3's renewed focus on melee combat, how Last of Us' development impacted the team, and why Uncharted 3 almost shipped with a game-breaking bug. 

Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and co-founder and the CEO of Kinda Funny Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's third outing.

  BioWare Teases Next Dragon Age Game With The Dread Wolf Rises






            During the Game Awards, BioWare showed off a teaser for the next Dragon Age game, but it really was a tease. We don't know much about the game at this point, but the video's slow pan out to a hashtag #TheDreadWolfRises will have to satisfy us for now.

The Dread Wolf is likely a reference to Fen'Harel, the elven god of betrayal that talked about in that game's fiction. Hopefully, he's cool.

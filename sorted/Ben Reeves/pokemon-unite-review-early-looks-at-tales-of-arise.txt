  Pokémon Unite Review, Early Looks At Tales of Arise And Darkest Dungeon II – GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of games we've been digging recently, including Pokémon Unite, Wildermyth, Genshin Impact 2.0, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, Neo: The World Ends with You, and Tribes of Midgard. We also talk about our newest Game Informer cover story: Tales of Arise. Then Dan describes his time talking to Red Hook Studios about Darkest Dungeon II.

Pokémon Unite has been one of the bigger surprises and might be a good breakout MOBA for a lot of people. Alex says he "can't put this damn game down. It's a genuinely fun MOBA with a pocket monster twist, and it's probably better than you think." Wildermyth is an indie strategy game that shouldn't be overlooked. We were a little late to the review party, but in his review, Dan said, "If you’ve always wanted a fantasy Dungeons & Dragons stylized XCOM game, Wildermyth might be exactly what you’re looking for." Meanwhile, Neo: The World Ends With You is the long-awaited sequel to the beloved JRPG The World End With You. Kim said, "It captures the magic of what made the first game so special, but it also retains some of its bigger issues and frustrations with difficulty balancing and the repetition of tedious tasks."

It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Dan Tack (@dantack), Jill Grodt (@Finruin), Alex Van Aken (@itsVanAken), Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for a new wild and ever-entertaining episode!

  GI Show – We Played Immortals Fenyx Rising And Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show we talk about a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including: Avengers, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, Star Renegades, and the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake. Then we speak with voice actress Laura Bailey, who shares some behind-the-scenes details about her portrayal of Black Widow (Marvel's Avengers) and Nadine Ross (Uncharted 4), as well as her time on the D&D show Critical Role. Finally, we end the show with another fantastic round of community emails and Meaningless Character Rankings. So please join Jeff Cork, Dan Tack, Kimberley Wallace, Alex Stadnik, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!

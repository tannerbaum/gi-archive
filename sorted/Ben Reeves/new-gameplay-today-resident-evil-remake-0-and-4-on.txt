  New Gameplay Today â€“ Resident Evil Remake, 0, And 4 On Switch






            If you're a Resident Evil fan, then 2019 is shaping up to be a good year. Not only did we get the phenomenal Resident Evil 2 remake earlier this year, but some of the series' best (and Resident Evil 0) have just released on the Nintendo Switch.

Join Leo Vader, Kyle Hilliard, and Ben Reeves and they revisit these classics. Yes, Ben is still trying to figure out how to hold a controller, so go ahead and make fun of him in the comments below.

Also, if you love Resident Evil 4, watch our Super Replay where we play through the entire game on PS4.

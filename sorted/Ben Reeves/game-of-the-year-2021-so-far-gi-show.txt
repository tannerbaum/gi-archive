  Game Of The Year 2021 (So Far) – GI Show






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of games we've been digging recently, including Sea of Thieves: A Pirate’s Life, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights, Wildermyth, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and Lego Builder's Journey. Then we spend a good part of the show talking about the best games we've played so far this year and speculate about what could end up being our Game Of The Year for 2021. Will it be Resident Evil: Village, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, or could it be a game we haven't even played yet like Metroid Dread or Halo Infinite?

It's a full show, but we make time for another round of fantastic community emails. So please join Dan Tack (@dantack), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for a new wild and ever-entertaining episode!

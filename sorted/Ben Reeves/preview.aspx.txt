  Sackboy Makes A Break For The Handheld Market




Sackboy is so cute we just want to take him with us wherever we go. Thankfully Sony anticipated our desire and is hard at work on a portable version of its hit PS3 platformer. Just like its console brethren, players will be able to create their own diabolical levels, and then set them loose on the world or race through them with friends. Of course, uncreative individuals will be happy to know that this version of LittleBigPlanet will also feature a brand new adventure mode filled with levels developed specifically for the PSP. If the rumors hold true you should be able to take Sackboy with you as you do all your holiday shopping.

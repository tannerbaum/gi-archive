  GI Show – Early Review Impressions For Marvel's Avengers And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show we talk about a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including: Avengers, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, Wasteland 3, and The Last Campfire. It's a massive Playlist segment, so we don't have time for much else. Fortunately, we make time for another fantastic round of community emails and Meaningless Character Rankings. So please join Brian Shea, Dan Tack, Alex Stadnik, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!

  Replay – BlackSite: Area 51






            How would you start a game about aliens? Would it be with an epic set-piece where a giant alien destroys a town? A moody, claustrophobic crawl through an alien-infested labyrinth? Or would you do like Midway's BlackSite: Area 51 and feature nearly an hour of generic military shooting through brown environments? They're all good options, I guess.

Join Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, Leo Vader, and Ben Reeves as they drive through a desert looking for aliens. We certainly have a bigger reaction to the creatures than any of our in-game squadmates.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

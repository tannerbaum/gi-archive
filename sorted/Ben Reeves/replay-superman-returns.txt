  Replay — Superman Returns






            EA Tiburon is best known for its work on the Madden NFL series, but in 2006 the studio released Superman Returns – a tie-in game to the movie of the same name. Superman 64 gets all the heat for being the worst Superman game, but sadly Superman Returns doesn't look much better.

Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, Leo Vader, and special guest Frank Cifaldi as we relive Superman's open world adventure and explore the worst highway in Metropolis.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

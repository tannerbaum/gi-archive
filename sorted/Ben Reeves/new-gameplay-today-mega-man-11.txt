  New Gameplay Today â€“ Mega Man 11






            Mega Man took an extended break from gaming, but our favorite blue robot (sorry Bluestreak) is finally back. Join Jeff Cork, Kyle Hilliard, Leo Vader, and Ben Reeves as they show off Mega Man 11's new gameplay, which actually feels fairly old. Thankfully, Mega Man's action has aged perfectly, so if you're a Mega Man fan this is one to get. Read our review here. Now we'll shut up so you can watch the video.

Mega Man 11 is out tomorrow, October 2, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

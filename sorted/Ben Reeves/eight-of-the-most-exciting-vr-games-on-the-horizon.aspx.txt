  Eight Of The Most Exciting VR Games On The Horizon






The VR landscape is the proverbial wild west of game development. Game makers don’t entirely understand how to best make use of the new technology, but it will be fun to watch them figure it out. The big VR headsets haven’t even released yet, but there are already a number of VR projects worth getting excited over. Here are our picks for the best VR games to play once you get your hands on a headset. 
Bullet TrainDeveloper: Epic GamesPlatform: RiftThis Time Crisis-style first-person shooter places users into the middle of a series of bullet-happy firefights. Players use Oculus’ Touch controllers to pick up, aim, and fire an arsenal of weapons and can teleport across the battlefield at will. However, the most exciting aspect of the game is that players can actually grab bullets, and even rockets, out of the air and throw them back at their foes.

I Expect You To DieDeveloper: Schell GamesPlatform: RiftI Expect You To Die isn’t just a classic James Bond line, it’s an inventive puzzle game where players are locked inside a car, and must use their wits and the power of telekinesis to escape from an elaborately trapped car without blowing up. Reminiscent of mobile hits like The Room, I Expect You To Die is a creative puzzle game that will force you to use the objects around you in creative ways. You’ll likely die a lot, but that’s almost as fun as winning. 
The London HeistDeveloper: London StudioPlatform: PlayStation VRDeveloped by Sony’s London Studio, The London Heist is reminiscent of classic Guy Ritchie ganger flicks like Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The demos we’ve seen so far have had us using the PlayStation Move controller in a series of shootouts that take place everywhere from posh London mansions to the front of a lorry during a high-speed highways chase.

Job SimulatorDeveloper: Owlchemy LabsPlatform: Rift, Vive, PlayStation VRBy 2050, robots have put us all out of a job. Thankfully, Job Simulator has archived the classic office experience for posterity. In this tongue-and-cheek look at our daily lives, players get to step into the roles of a gourmet chef, an office worker, and a convenience store clerk. It sounds silly, but Job Simulator’s absurd environments are incredibly engrossing, and we had a blast just trying to photocopy donuts or throwing every item in a kitchen into a cooking pot. 
ChronosDeveloper: Gunfire GamesPlatform: RiftUnlike a lot of VR games which simulate first-person action, Chronos is a classic third-person action RPG. Chronos chronicles one hero’s lifelong quest to explore a massive labyrinth looking for the secrets to restore peace to his homeland. Players start their journey as a young adventurer who is nimble, but advancing age will turn them slower as they grow more powerful and attuned to magic.

  GI Show – Psychonauts 2 And Mass Effect Legendary Edition






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Mass Effect Legendary Edition, The Ascent, Returnal, Aerial_Knight's Never Yield, and Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis. We also recently announced that Psychonauts 2 is the latest game to grace the cover of Game Informer Magazine, so we spend a good deal of time talking about Double Fine's upcoming platformer and what we learned during our interviews with the studio. 

It's a full show, but we make time for another round of fantastic community emails. So please join Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad), Dan Tack (@dantack), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for a new wild and ever-entertaining episode!

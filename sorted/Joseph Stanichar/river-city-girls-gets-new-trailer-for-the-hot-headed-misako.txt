  River City Girls Gets New Trailer For The Hot-Headed Misako






            Wayforward released a new trailer for its upcoming game, River City Girls, giving a more in-depth look into one of the two main heroines: the energetic and tough Misako.

River City Girls is a beat-'em-up by Wayforward set within the River City franchise, with a few twists. For one, the installment shakes up River City's visual style, integrating more color and detailed environments than 2016's more traditional River City: Tokyo Rumble. The other twist: River City protagonists Kunio and Riki have been kidnapped, so it's up to their girlfriends, Misako and Kyoko, to save them.

You can see the original teaser trailer for River City Girls here. The game launches on PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PCÂ on September 5.

  Fan Creates Super Mario Maker 2 Course With Lower Chance Of Success Than Winning A Lottery






YouTuber PangaeaPanga has been making Mario Maker stages for years, but his most recent may be one of the most devious. If you know the secret, it's a cakewalk. If you don't, however, you could spend your entire life trying to figure it out and never clear the stage.

Essentially, you're guessing a credit card number. For each digit, you hit a POW block a number of times. If you're correct, a ramp will carry the block to a pit, but every digit needs to be correct in order for the pit to be completely filled. A bob-omb will then waddle over the pit and destroy the wall in front of you, allowing you to move to the end.

You have the same chances of blindly guessing someone's credit card number as you do clearing this stage. Or, at least, you would, but PangaeaPanga has mercifully released the code for everyone to use. He promised to release the code after 15 clears, and at the time of the video, there were 32. It is impossible to know whether those clears were legitimate or the result of hacking. Given the sheer unlikelihood of guessing the correct number out of 27,049 attempts, we would place our money on the latter.

The code is: 57231289 89210857. There is no significance to this number, as PangaeaPanga got it from a random number generator. If you want to play the course yourself with this newfound knowledge, the course ID is 6SQ-DLG-Y2G.

PangaeaPanga is currently working on a course that has an even slimmer chance of being cleared. The number of possible combinations has 75 digits!

Super Mario Maker 2 is available exclusively on Nintendo Switch. For more on the game, check out our review, what other themes we'd love to see in the game, and the levels we've made ourselves!

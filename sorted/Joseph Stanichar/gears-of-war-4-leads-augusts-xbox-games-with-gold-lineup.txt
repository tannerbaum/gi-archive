  Gears Of War 4 Leads August's Xbox Games With Gold Lineup






If you're excited for the upcoming Gears 5, you'll have the chance to play the game's predecessor for free with a Xbox Live Gold subscription, throughout the entire month of August. We loved the game when it launched in 2016, giving it a 9.25, with reviewer Andrew Reiner writing, "Gears of War 4 is a return to form for the series, and is a continual delight, even if it does unnecessarily cling for dear life to the past."

The other Xbox One offering this month is Forza Motorsport 6, which reviewer Matthew Kato called "as fun as it is disappointing," giving it a 7.75. While not a perfect game, it's still worth checking out for its fast-paced and comprehensive racing experience. The game will be free with an Xbox Live Gold account August 15 through September 16.

Xbox 360 owners aren't being left in the dust either, with two noteworthy titles offered for the month. The Diablo clone Torchlight isn't shy about its influence, but former PC reviewer Adam Biessener gave the game an 8.75 for being "the best take on Diablo since Diablo II" in 2011. Torchlight will be free through the service August 1 through 15.

For the second half of the month, we have Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, which reviewer Tim Turi gave a 9, praising the 3D take on the franchise for its "incredible boss battles, rewarding exploration, and unforgettable conclusion." You can claim the game for free August 16 through 31. Both Xbox 360 games are also playable on Xbox One.

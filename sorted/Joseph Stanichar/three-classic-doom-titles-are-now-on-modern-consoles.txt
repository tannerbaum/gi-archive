  Three Classic Doom Titles Are Now On Modern Consoles






During today's QuakeCon presentation, Bethesda shadow-dropped three beloved games from the action-packed series' infancy. Available today on a new set of platforms, 1993's Doom, 1994's Doom II, and 2004's Doom 3 are now more easily accessible than they've ever been.

Panic Button, which has done fantastic work creating ports of Doom (2016), Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, and today's Wolfenstein: Youngblood for the Nintendo Switch, worked their magic again to have Doom 3 run on the system.

The three games are available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, and Android. Doom and Doom II cost $4.99, whereas Doom 3 costs $9.99. The games require you to log into a free Bethesda account before playing for the first time, but after that you're free to play offline.

Bethesda also took the time to focus on this year's new Doom game, Doom Eternal, which launches November 22 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC.

  A Hat In Time Receives Release Date For Nintendo Switch






Nearly a year ago, developer Gears for Breakfast announced A Hat in Time would come to the Nintendo Switch "soon." It's a bit of a stretch to say they kept that promise, but nonetheless, we now have a release date for the title through Amazon, as well as details on additional features.

The physical versionÂ of A Hat in Time will include the Seal the Deal DLC, which contains a new chapter titled The Arctic Cruise, an aptly named difficulty mode, Death Wish, and other items and cosmetic goodies. While the DLC is free for Switch, it does require a download, as it's not on the cartridge itself. Seal the Deal was previously only available on PC, making this the first console version to get the DLC.

The Switch version also adds co-op, which is another first for consoles.

A Hat in Time is currently available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Switch version will launch October 18. For more on the game, read our review.

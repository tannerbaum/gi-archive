  Bubble Bobble Returns In Adorable Announcement Trailer 






            Following more than a 10-year hiatus, the single-toothed Bulb and friends are starring in a new game in the Bubble Bobble series: the aptly titled Bubble Bobble 4 Friends. The game will feature up to four-player co-op, an assortment of levels, and a whole lot of cuteness.

Bubble Bobble was originally an arcade cabinet in 1986, but soon came to every other platform under the sun. The simple puzzle-platformer won the hearts of the old and young with its light difficulty, two-player co-op, cute designs, and catchy theme. Myriad sequels came after, but the more recent entries on PSP, WiiWare, and Xbox Live Arcade have generally been panned for adding unnecessary complications to the game's original simple format.

We'll see if Bubble Bobble 4 Friends can reverse this trend when it launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch. European players will get the game November 19, whereas American audiences will have to wait until quarter one of 2020 to get their hands on it. (Or you could make a European account, as the Switch is region-free.)

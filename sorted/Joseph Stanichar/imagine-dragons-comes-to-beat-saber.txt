Beat Saber has engrossed us since launch, and with additional music packs and mods growing the game's levels, support for the title doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. Launching today, you can play 10 new levels, each covering a different song from the popular band Imagine Dragons.

The songs included are:

“Bad Liar”
“Believer”
“Digital”
“It’s Time”
“Machine”
“Natural”
“Radioactive”
“Thunder”
“Warriors”
“Whatever It Takes”

Furthermore, Beat Games are showing off their new 360° level of "Believer" on the show floor at E3, which will launch sometime later this summer.

Beat Saber is available on PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and the newly released Oculus Quest. You can buy each song individually for $1.99, or all 10 for $12.99.

  Just Cause 4: Danger Rising DLC Gets Release Date In Bombastic New Trailer






            If you've been looking for an excuse to hop back into Just Cause 4's explosive sandbox world, you won't have long to wait until its newest DLC addition, Danger Rising, is ready for you.

The third and final DLC pack in the "Dare Devils, Demons, and Danger" expansion pass, Danger Rising gives you access to eight new missions, and some destructive toys to complete them with. Among these include the powerful Sequoia 370 Mag-Slug, gravity manipulating Stormalong Em Zero magnesis rifle, and the Yellowstone Auto Sniper Rifle, which is able to deploy remote-controlled drones.

Most prominently featured, however, is the hoverboard. This new piece of tech will open up new ways of traversal for players, allowing you to "speed across the surface of the ocean, grind along rails and kickflip over exploding helicopters," according to Square Enix.

Just Cause 4: Danger Rising launches August 29 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It is available through the "Dare Devils, Demons, and Danger" expansion pass, which costs $29.99. For more on Just Cause 4, read our review.

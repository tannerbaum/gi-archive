  BioShock Movie Loses Director






Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is out as the director of the BioShock movie, and it appears the film is on indefinite hold.
Speaking to Indie Wire, it was confirmed he's no longer on the project. "To be honest, by now, I’m completely out of that, and developing other stuff," Fresnadillo said. "Right now it’s on hold. The studio and the videogame company, they have to reach some kind of agreement about the budget and the rating."
Irrational Games' Ken Levine said last year he is still in talks with Hollywood sources about getting the film made. "...we’ve had the opportunity to get it made and unless all the right pieces are in place – it’s hard enough to get a movie made when all the right pieces are in place," he said. "If you don’t start with the right pieces, you don’t have a prayer. We’ve had a lot of great talks with great people about it.
"We got close to great people, but you always have to have all of those pieces in place and that’s going to be very challenging. It’s a moving puzzle, but I’m going to be continually talking to people about it. It’s definitely something that’s still in the conversation."
Game Informer has reached out to Irrational Games for comment.

  Winter Is Coming In Fortnite’s Season 7 






This morning Fortnite tweeted out a reminder that season 7 of the popular battle royale is coming in three days. The cryptic tweet includes the silhouette of what appears to be a crowned ice wraith, and the message “A bitter ice spreads… 3 days to season 7.”

Could Fortnite be channeling its inner Game of Thrones, which airs its final season in 2019? Could there be a possible Ice King skin from the popular animated series Adventure Time as @MikeDoww tweeted out? Or is this just another update celebrating the winter season as Fortnite did with season 6, honoring fall with spooky Halloween-themed gear?

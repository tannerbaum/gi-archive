  Skull & Bones Won't Be Shown At Ubisoft Forward






Ubisoft Singapore's Skull & Bones is a multiplayer action title where factions of pirates battle amid treacherous seas. The game has already gone through a series of delays and, unfortunately, fans will have to wait even longer. Creative Director Elisabeth Pellen published a letter on the Skull & Bones blog that chronicled the next steps in the development cycle. She affirmed that Skull & Bones won't be shown during the Ubisoft Forward stream.

"Critical questions needed to be addressed over the past several months," Pellen writes. "Such as: how do we modernize the classic pirate fantasy? How do we ensure a more immersive and visceral experience? How do we create cool and memorable moments in-game? For most of these questions to be answered, it was clear that we needed more development time." 

While we're sure that the game has gone through changes since its premier and demo, we enjoyed our time with Skull & Bones back in 2017.

  The Trine Series Is Coming To Switch This Spring






            Frozenbyte plans to release the entirety of its Trine Series on the Nintendo Switch this Spring. Already available for physical pre-orders, Trine: Enchanted Edition, Trine 2: Complete Story, and Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power explore the whimsical adventures of franchise protagonists Amadeus, Pontius, and Zoya. Showcasing Frozenbyte’s knack for puzzle-platformers, the bundle is priced at $39.99. 

Trine 2: Complete Story, however, will be released early through the eShop for Switch owners on February 18. As a stand-alone title, Trine 2 is $16.99. With over 20 levels of hand-drawn content and a local as well as online co-op mode, players will finally be able to take their favorite fantastical side-scrollers on the go. 

If these three games can’t satiate your Trine hunger, don’t worry. Last fall, Frozenbyte confirmed the development of Trine 4 which will also be available on Switch (alongside PC, PlayStation4 and Xbox One) later this year.

  Ranking The 10 Best Lego Games 






            Legos bridge the gap between the tangible and the imagined, allowing children and adults to build and tell their own stories. Digital Lego experiences primarily pull from some of society's most popular IPs, meaning that same unhindered level of creativity can be applied to our favorite fantasy settings and comic heroes. Here is our definitive ranking for the top 10 Lego games:

            Lego Creator

            Ever heard of Minecraft? Of course, you have. How about Lego Creator, an open-ended sandbox game from the late '90s developed by Superscape? The acclaimed autonomy and creativity inherent in Mojang’s cultural phenomenon appeared in this gem a little over a decade earlier. Lego Creator has no missions, challenges, or progression constraints. Instead, it leverages the Lego trademarks' most infectious interaction: building with blocks. A free-form constriction model meant that players could construct the cities of their dreams and then view their wild creations from the perspective of a Minifigure. Later versions of the game implemented themes – from fantasy-inspired blocks in Lego Creator: Knights’ Kingdom to the wizarding world of Harry Potter (not to be confused with another entry on this list). Lego Creator might be an award-winning gem, but its outdated UI and systems prevent it from earning a higher spot on this list.

            Lego Builder's Journey

            Lego Builder’s Journey flew under the radar when it launched for mobile devices in 2019. Its more prominent indie influences, however, were clear. Minimalist, evocative art reminiscent of Fez’s 2.5D style coupled with atmospheric music makes Builder’s Journey the most cathartic entry on this list. The miniature levels are outdoorsy locales – mountain trails, beaches, woods – where players use a limited amount of Lego pieces to create navigable pathways for their Minifigure. There’s not much here mechanically, but there’s an elegance to the variety of challenging puzzles; some require players to color match, build with limited sightlines, or complete objectives under time restrictions. Builder’s Journey is a bite-sized experiment that promises casual, low-stakes sessions for puzzle enthusiasts. | Our Review

            Lego Harry Potter Collection

            This blocky reimagining of the Harry Potter movies smartly employs mechanics from previous TT Games titles. Activating spells is as responsive and accessible as using the various Force powers in the higher-ranked entries. And while the upcoming Hogwarts Legacy offers a comprehensive look at never-before-seen sectors of the magical world, the Lego Harry Potter Collection did it first. Almost all of Hogwarts is navigable and filled with puzzles and secrets, expanding on hidden areas that the films neglected. Like the books, combat takes a back seat which might alienate players that enjoyed the constant flux of action in the Lego Star Wars games. Even so, this Harry Potter adaptation bursts forth with enough charm and whimsy to earn the eighth spot. | Our Reviews: Years 1-4 & Years 5-7

            Lego The Lord of the Rings

            Lego games are known for numerous features: exploration, puzzle-platforming, item collection, and combat, all wrapped in a comedic romp for families and friends. It makes sense that these qualities transferred perfectly to Tolkien’s Mordor. Lego Lord of the Rings is a bit of an outlier on this list. Not because it changes the loop in revolutionary ways – it doesn’t, and that’s okay! – but because the high fantasy adventure implements music/voice-acting from Peter Jackson’s trilogy, tones down the humor, and even implements a free roam open-world! What more could Lord of the Rings fans want? | Our Review

            Lego City Undercover

            What happens when TT Games divests itself of major licenses and attempts to tell an original story with unconventional mechanics? You get City Undercover, a cop-drama set in the open-world playground, Lego City. Players star as undercover officer Chase McCain, tracking down and defeating criminals with parkour, ability-specific disguises, and pilotable vehicles. If you're imagining a lighthearted GTA, you're not far off the mark. Lego City Undercover reminds us that TT Games' license-centric design isn't a crutch. Hopefully, we'll see a proper sequel to Chase McCain's epic journey for justice sometime soon. | Our Review

            Lego Dimensions

            Lego Dimensions is a crossover joyride featuring over thirty franchises, including Adventure Time, Beetlejuice, and The Wizard of Oz. Nowadays, crossovers are the bread and butter of many popular games. However, Lego Dimensions’ real-life toy counterparts amplify the moment-to-moment interactivity – think Disney Infinity's purchasable characters but with buildable playsets. Dimensions' eclectic collection of levels, characters, and stories lead to wacky combinations, like Batman fighting alongside Gandalf or The Lego Movie's plot seamlessly bleeding into The Simpsons. Lego Dimensions is a riot that mixes analog and digital play to great effect. | Our Review

            Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes

            Lego Batman 2 is a step up from its predecessor, as all sequels should be. TT Games' first voice-acted/open-world project made its heroes and Gotham feel more relatable and enticing while also paving the way for the cohesive narratives and scattered secrets in many of the other titles on this list. Superman and the Justice League join Batman and Robin as playable characters giving the post-campaign even more replay value. Sure, the side activities can be repetitive, but Lego Batman 2 earns its fourth spot because of how it influenced TT Games' approach to world design. | Our Review

            Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga

            The Star Wars series serves as TT Games’ best work for many Lego purists, and who could blame them? The Complete Saga is an exciting, vibrant trip to a galaxy far, far away, chockful of nerdy hilarity. Episodes I-III are good fun, but IV-VI are taken straight from the acclaimed Lego Star Wars II and continue to be some of the brightest experiences in TT Games’ gameography. Force powers, epic lightsaber duels reimagined for the controller/keyboard, and simple, but fun, environmental puzzles make The Complete Saga an easy top-three choice.

            Lego Marvel Super Heroes

            Like the blockbuster films that inspired it, Lego Marvel Super Heroes features memorable setpieces, world-shattering battles, and unmatched style to boot. Boasting over 150 characters – including the late, great Stan Lee! – each with their own personalized move sets, players can sprint, swing, or fly through iconic locations like Stark Tower, Asgard, and even New York City. Moreover, a series of side missions narrated by Deadpool help fill in the downtime between the multilayered levels and bombastic boss fights – there’s just so much to do. At its core, Lego Marvel Super Heroes showcases the TT Games loop at its most polished and refined, which speaks volumes about the impressiveness of the list’s top entry. | Our Review

            Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga

            It doesn’t get any bigger or better than The Skywalker Saga. Where the Complete Saga’s novelty emerged from combining the first two Lego Star Wars games without reinventing the wheel, The Skywalker Saga brings players as close to the magic of George Lucas’ enthralling universe as possible. From Luke Skywalker’s clandestine archipelago on Ahch-To to the forested Kashyyk, The Skywalker Saga presents massive hubs and galactic travel – unparalleled freedom is at the heart of the gameplay. Discover pathways with fun secrets, complete side quests for currency/collectibles, and fend off the Sith with newly-implemented lightsaber combos. Better yet, do it all with a friend in couch co-op! The Skywalker Saga is the best Lego game ever made because of its ambitious scope and the unmeasurable entertainment pumped into every frame and goofy pixel. | Our Review

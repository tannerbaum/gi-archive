  Five Next-Gen Worlds To Be Excited About






            We are at the precipice of a new and enhanced generation of gaming. I couldn't be any more excited for what the future holds! The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have a bevy of exclusive and upgraded titles planned for their unannounced launch dates and beyond. Because of that, there's so much to look forward to and too much to talk about. So, instead, I've selected five original IPs that I'm looking forward to the most.

GhostWire: Tokyo (PlayStation 5, PC)

Sorry, this video is not available

GhostWire Tokyo was unexpectedly announced at last year's Bethesda Conference. Since then, fans far and wide have only been gifted a limited amount of info on the game's setting, characters, and gameplay. Nonetheless, the swelling excitement directed toward Tango Gamework's mysterious, paranormal RPG is undeniable. As far as we know, the night-shrouded streets of Tokyo serve as the game's primary backdrop. Players star as an unnamed main character with supernatural powers that must save the citizens of Japan's bustling capital from horrific, spiritual beings. With jaw-dropping visuals that showcase Tokyo's dense urban and suburban districts as well as fear-inducing poltergeists, players are in for a downright horrifying experience. And if that's not nearly enough to satisfy your interest in the game, we've got you covered with some Answers To Our Biggest GhostWire Tokyo Questions.

Project Athia (PlayStation 5, PC)

Sorry, this video is not available

Project Athia's short trailer at Sony's PlayStation presentation impressed audiences. Luminous Productions - the developer of Final Fantasy XV - hasn't shown much footage of the game other than its cloaked heroine navigating a dangerous, mystical environment. You can definitely spot Final Fantasy's influence on the new IP in the protagonist's magical powers as well as the sinister fauna that appear in the announcement trailer. Luminous Productions also recently revealed the power of their world-building game engine. The various terrain and biomes on display are reminders that Project Athia's sandbox will be fun to explore and beautiful to look at. 

Returnal (PlayStation 5)

Sorry, this video is not available

Returnal missed out on the buzz that larger, franchise-focused announcements like Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Horizon Forbidden West garnered. However, as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, Returnal has the potential to be just as interesting and technically impressive. Housemarque's first departure from previous titles in the arcade genre, is a moody sci-fi thriller. Not much is known about the action shooter, but the psychedelic imagery in the game's first trailer makes us think that the Returnal might be attempting to chronicle the abstract themes of existential dread. 

The Medium (Xbox Series X, PC) 

Sorry, this video is not available

Bloober Team is known for experimental horror titles like Blair Witch and the Layers of Fear series. Their reality-bending game, The Medium, is next in line. As a medium named Marriane, players will be tasked with traversing two dimensions: the normal world as we know it, and its spiritual counterpart, filled with skulking monsters and unnerving architecture. The soundtrack, composed by Akira Yamaoka of Silent Hill renown, is likely to enhance the game's sinister atmosphere and haunt players long after they've beaten the game. The Medium will be available this holiday season. 

Avowed (Xbox Series X, PC)

Sorry, this video is not available

Like many gamers around the globe, we couldn't get enough of Obsidian Entertainment's The Outer Worlds last year. So, it came as an exciting surprise, when their next gen, first-person IP Avowed was announced at this year's Xbox Games Showcase. As of right now, all we have is this stunning cinematic trailer to analyze and unpack, but Avowed's visuals alone look like a healthy (and much-needed) mix of Elder Scrolls and The Lord of the Rings. If the polish, world-building, and characters of The Outer Worlds were any indication, Avowed looks to be one of the many crowning achievements of next gen gaming. 

Are you also looking forward to diving into these games? Are there any other titles that aren't in my list that you've been keeping your eye on? Or, are you still unsure of whether or not the next gen consoles are all they're cracked up to be? Trust me, they most definitely are.

  Telltale Games Gives Short Update On The Wolf Among Us Season 2






Telltale Games has seen its fair share of success and adversity. A large majority of gamers know the studio from its work on The Walking Dead; a critically acclaimed episodic adventure that started releasing a little under a decade ago. Others recognize Telltale Games as the developers behind The Wolf Among Us - another episodic adventure that chronicled a noir version of Aesop's Fables. The Wolf Among Us Season 2 was supposed to release in 2019, but there's been radio silence on its development and new release date. Today, Telltale Games released a statement on Twitter, updating fans on the state of The Wolf Among Us Season 2.

In their tweet, Telltale Games assured readers that The Wolf Among Us Season 2 is still being developed and that "...when the time is right, we're going to have a LOT to talk about." Unfortunately, other pending Telltale titles - games that weren't specifically named in the statement - have been reclaimed by their original IP owners. But, at least The Wolf Among Us Season 2 is definitely on its way!

Telltale Games is working to complete the entire season at once so, until the studio is ready to reveal more in-depth details on the narrative and gameplay, the small update will have to suffice. There is no planned release date for The Wolf Among Us Season 2, but hopefully we'll get a concrete announcement at some point in 2021.

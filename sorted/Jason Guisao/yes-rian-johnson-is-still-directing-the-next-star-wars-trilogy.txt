In 2017, Disney hired Rian Johnson to direct the next Star Wars trilogy after this year’s Episode IX. Johnson, director of the polarizing Episode VIII, professed his excitement in a now deleted tweet: “Obviously, I hope you like The Last Jedi. But, man, now I REALLY hope you like The Last Jedi.”

Recently, rumors have been circulating around the internet about Johnson’s apparent separation from the project. He quickly took to twitter to dispel the confusion, referencing the SuperBroMovies news outlet, where these rumors are believed to have originated. 

News on Johnson’s upcoming trilogy is limited, but JJ Abram’s Episode IX hits theaters everywhere on December 20.

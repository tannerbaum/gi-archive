According to a post that was uploaded on the official Xbox website, Microsoft Rewards and Gift Card combo are returning to this year‚Äôs Summer Spotlight,¬†‚ÄúThe Microsoft Rewards and Gift Card combo was so popular last year that we decided to bring the offer back for buying Summer Spotlight titles, which will also include some popular selections from Microsoft Movies & TV,‚Äù the article reads.¬†‚ÄúAs an added bonus, spend $50 on eligible titles and you will receive 5,000 Microsoft Rewards points and a $5 gift card. The deal gets even better for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members who will receive a $10 gift card.‚Äù

While a large majority of the incoming games are still relatively unknown, here are a few that are already out or launching soon that you should be aware of:

Death‚Äôs Door

Death‚Äôs Door is an action-adventure game with gorgeous art and fun gameplay. Our very own Marcus Stewart reviewed the game and gave it a 9, ‚ÄúDeath‚Äôs Door is more lighthearted than it looks, and that‚Äôs to its benefit. These amusing moments complement weightier themes about respecting the dead (no matter how terrible they were in life), the fear of death‚Äôs inevitability, and whether anything we accomplish truly matters when our time is limited.‚Äù

You can download Death‚Äôs Door right now!

Hades

Hades is an incredible isometric rogue-like from the minds behind Bastion and Transistor. It was also my Game of the Year in 2020. Matt Miller enjoyed his time with it and stated, ‚ÄúSupergiant‚Äôs latest opus is a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships. High-octane action gameplay may pull you into hell for the first time, but I suspect you‚Äôll stay to find out about this eccentric and fascinating family.‚Äù

Hades launches on August 13.

Other titles, like The Ascent, 12 Minutes, The Forgotten City, and Aliens: Fireteam Elite are slated to come out this and next month.¬†

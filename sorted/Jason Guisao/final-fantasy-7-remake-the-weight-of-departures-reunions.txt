  Final Fantasy 7 Remake: The Weight Of Departures & Reunions






            The original Final Fantasy VII catapulted JRPGs into the limelight and established a new standard for expansive gameworlds and emotional stories. Final Fantasy VII Remake is an homage to and reimagining of its predecessor's motifs: Eco-activism, classism, atonement, and companionship (among many other important themes). We demonstrate how Remake's plot beats can be reevaluated with the themes of departure and reunion in mind.

Square Enix plans to tell Cloud’s extensive story in parts but, because the first entry solely focuses on Midgar, Final Fantasy VII veterans get to experience the original game’s introductory setting and characters in more nuanced ways. The high stakes remain the same: The fallout from the Mako Reactor 1 and 5 bombings, the eventual destruction of the slums, and Sephiroth’s sudden and terrifying return. Our video essay considers these emotional moments and looks to provide other interpretations surrounding Remake’s most important plot motivations.

There are many scenes that Square Enix will have to reveal and unpack in upcoming installments, but we’re excited to see what the future holds for Cloud and co. In other Final Fantasy VII news, today marks the 25th anniversary of the classic JRPG steampunk adventure. Apparently, there are "even more new FFVII projects" slated for the future.

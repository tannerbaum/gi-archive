  Kid Goku (GT) Is Coming To Dragon Ball FighterZ






Kid Goku – as he appears in the Dragon Ball GT series – is joining the roster of Arc System Works' Dragon Ball FighterZ. While there are already a plethora of Goku variations in the game, Kid Goku brings his iconic Power Pole weapon to the fight. Details about his move list are limited but from pictures we can see that the Power Pole allows Kid Goku to quickly swing into action and may even be a crucial component to his combos. 

Kid Goku is expected to be included with other characters during the steady release of the Season 2 DLC. Videl and Jiren dropped earlier this year, but some rumors speculate that Ultra Instinct Goku and Super Saiyan 4 Goku will be coming to the game at some point in the near future as well.

According to the official PlayStation Blog, "the inaugural Game Catalog lineup for the all-new PlayStation Plus"¬†drops for Extra and Premium members this month.

Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode.¬†

The following games are also available on July 19:

Marvel‚Äôs Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin's Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag | PS4

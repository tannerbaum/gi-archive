  Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time Remake Delayed By Two Months






Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time originally released in 2003 for PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC. Kyle Hilliard considered it to be an essential game because of its tight parkour controls, flashy combat, and time-bending mechanics/narrative. A remake was announced in September during a Ubisoft press conference with Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai slated to head the game's development. Unfortunately, the remake has been delayed - however, you won't have to wait long as the release has only been pushed back two months. 

A message from The Sands of Time dev team was posted to Twitter today stating, "we wanted to let you know that we are taking additional time to work on the game...we believe that this is the right call to ensure we will deliver a game you will enjoy."

The last Prince of Persia installment dropped over a decade ago. Ubisoft has since shifted gears to focus on its acclaimed Assassin's Creed franchise as well as tactical shooters like The Division and Rainbow Six: Siege. Even though the delay might be deflating to some fans, it's nice to know that The Sands of Time Remake will be playable very soon. 

The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was originally planned for a January 2021 release but the delay pushes the launch date to March 18, 2021. You'll be able to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC for $40. There are no plans to release next-gen specific versions of the game, but you'll be able to play on your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S through backwards compatibility.

  The Lord of the Rings – Gollum Gets Delayed To 2022






            The world had no idea that it needed a Gollum-focused video game until Daedalic announced its Lord of the Rings project in Summer 2019. The game was set to launch at some point this year, but GamesRadar reports that The Lord of the Rings – Gollum will be delayed to 2022. 

Apparently, a recent email announced a new partnership between Deadelic Entertainment and Nacon who is now set to be a co-publisher on the game. Nacon has been involved with a few sports titles as well as the upcoming Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong. The email ends with the information about the game's delay.

A narrative-centric experience, Daedalic’s Gollum game chronicles ex-Hobbit Sméagol’s vile journey as he is corrupted by the One Ring. While players will likely see story beats that they are already familiar with, the game will also delve into new events in Gollum's life. "We tell Gollum's story from a perspective never seen before, in any storytelling medium, all the while staying true to the legendary books of J.R.R. Tolkien," says Daedalic CEO Carsten Fichtelmann. "At a time when the games industry is undergoing structural changes and seeing new business models evolve, we are excited to realize a huge new production based on a story that has stayed fresh and relevant for more than 60 years."

The Lord of the Rings – Gollum will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some photos from the game in a gallery here.

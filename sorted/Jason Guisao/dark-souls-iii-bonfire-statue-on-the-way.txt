  Dark Souls III Bonfire Statue On The Way






            A new Dark Souls III statue joins a massive repertoire of Gecco Direct collectibles. For $100, fans can receive a ⅙ scale (210 mm high) LED bonfire with a miniature sword. The sword, once inserted into the flames, activates the fire-red lights.

The bonfire, of course, has been a well-known staple in the Dark Souls series. Serving as a resting spot for the battered and weary, players can choose to restock their inventory, reinforce their stats in the first game, or upgrade their equipment (amid a plethora of other options). 

The statue, while already available for pre-order at this link, will not be released until the summer. In the meantime, don’t miss out on From Software’s latest title Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and the ways in which it improves upon and diverges from the Dark Souls formula. You can find the full hub of all our Sekiro information right here.

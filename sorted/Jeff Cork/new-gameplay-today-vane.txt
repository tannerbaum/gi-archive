  New Gameplay Today â€“ Vane






            Indie dev Friend & Foe released its atmospheric game Vane today, which features stylized visuals, a synthwave soundtrack, and a perplexing lack of direction. Kyle took some time to show Leo and me some of the game's early portions, from its explosive start to an unfortunate implosion.

Check out the video to see Kyle try to work his way through the first set of challenges. As a crow/raven, his job is to perch on a series of windsock-like devices and attract more birds to his flock. It goes well, until it doesn't.

Vane is out today on PlayStation 4.

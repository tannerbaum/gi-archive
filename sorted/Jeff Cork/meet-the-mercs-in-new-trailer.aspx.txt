Resident Evil: The Mercenaries - 3DS


  Meet The Mercs In New Trailer




Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D wouldn't be the same without those rascally mercenaries. If you'd like to see them get close and personal with a few of their closest undead buddies, you've come to the right place.
The latest trailer for the game shows off characters Chris, Jill, Barry, Hunk, Claire, Rebecca, Krauser, and Wesker as they face overwhelming odds, zombies, and zombies with exploding flower faces. At least, that's what I always thought those things looked like. Enjoy.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Valkyria Chronicles 4






            Joe Juba likes Valkyria Chronicles. Valkyria Chronicles 4 is coming out later this month. Who could pass up such an electrifying synergistic opportunity? Certainly not me and/or Leo. Joe joins us in today's episode to show why he's such a fan of Sega's tactical RPG.

Joe was kind enough to play through a scenario not once, but TWICE. The first time through, he takes a fairly conservative approach, methodically sizing up opponents and taking advantage of the terrain. The second time, all bets are off. No exploit is too cheap or sneaky for this guy, nosiree. It's a fun and instructive way to see how flexible the combat can be, once you figure out how to game the system.

Valkyria Chronicles 4 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 25.

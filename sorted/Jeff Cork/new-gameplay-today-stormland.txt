  New Gameplay Today – Stormland






            Insomniac's latest VR project drops players into a strange world, and an equally strange body. You're a robot! Kyle had a chance to play Stormland recently, and he shares his thoughts on the game with me, Leo, and Suriel. Also, I think he tries to make us barf at least once, but I'm not entirely sure.

As a robot, you can customize all your various bits and parts, and as a VR game you can move your weird-looking hands around and stare at them in amazement. Unfortunately, Kyle does not "raise the roof" at any point, which is something Leo helpfully suggested that Kyle should have done. Maybe next time?

Stormland is coming to Oculus next year.

  New Ultra Versions Of Pokémon Sun And Moon Coming To 3DS






Earlier this morning, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company revealed that the Pokémon franchise is coming to the Nintendo Switch, with the release of a Pokkén Tournament port. That's not the only Pokémon news on the horizon, however. Last year's Pokémon Sun & Moon is also getting an updated version, though Switch fans are going to have to sit this one out.
Pokémon UItra Sun & Moon are coming to the 3DS on November 17. They tell an alternate story from the original release, with the addition of Pokémon that weren't previously included. That's the only info that they were willing to share at this point.

Our TakeIt seems quite strange that this isn't coming to the Switch, but The Pokémon Company's gonna's Pokémon Company, and Nintendo's gonna' Nintendo.

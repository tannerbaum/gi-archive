  New Gameplay Today – Diablo IV's Druid Class






            Today, we're wrapping up our video series focusing on each of Diablo IV's announced classes. We've already covered the barbarian and sorceress, and now we're turning our attention to the druid. This returning favorite has a lot of new things to offer, most notably his ability to instantly transform from human to werewolf to werebear. It's good. Don't believe me? Watch this video!

Three of us played the demo at Blizzard's offices during our Diablo IV cover-story visit, and we did something a little different for this one. Rather than tackle each of the game's three announced characters, we all chose the druid. Expect lots of transformations, boulder rolling, and storm summoning.

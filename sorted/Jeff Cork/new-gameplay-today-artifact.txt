  New Gameplay Today – Artifact






            What's this? A new Valve game? It's true! Artifact is a new CCG based on the Dota franchise. It's only fitting that our own CCG-meister, Dan Tack, walks us through the ins and outs of the title, from deck construction to a victory. But a victory for who/whom?

The gameplay is a little on the slow side, but this is definitely one to watch. Tack is a great resource, showing Leo and me some top-tier strats. It gets off to a rocky start, with the RNG gods delivering disappointment after disappointment in the deck-building phase. Can he overcome this rough beginning? What, you think I'm going to tell you here? Watch the video! Sheesh!

Artifact is coming to PC officially on November 28.

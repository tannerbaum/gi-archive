  New Gameplay Today – Yoshi's Crafted World Preview






            Nintendo's dino pal is back, though let's be honest here – he's never really gone away. This time around, he's romping through more cuddly, handcrafted worlds. How is Yoshi's Crafted World? Game Informer's Imran Khan got to play some of the single-player and co-op, and also checked out the same level, both front and back. Don't worry, it'll all make sense.

Don't expect to be blown away by challenging platforming, Imran says. Instead, this one's all about having a chill adventure and solving light puzzles. He probably needs a break after getting smacked around in Smash, after all.

Yoshi's Crafted World is coming to Nintendo Switch on March 29.

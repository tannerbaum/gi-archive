Persona 5


  See Persona 5 In English In Today's Livestream




Atlus is showing off the English translation of Persona 5 today in a livestream. You can tune in to the publisher's official Twitch channel today at noon Pacific to see the game, as well as hear from some special guests and get a chance to win prizes.
In addition to today's livestream, Atlus released a new trailer for the game. It shows off what members of the game's Phantom Thieves do in their off time, which apparently includes fishing, baseball, and eating novelty-sized burgers.

Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy


  Level-5 Gives Professor Layton Spinoff A New Name, Release Date




Professor Layton fans have some more info to chew on regarding the upcoming spinoff, which stars the professor's daughter, Katrielle Layton. Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy (formerly called Lady Layton: The Millionaire Ariadone's Conspiracy) is coming to iOS and Android this July, with a 3DS version of the puzzle game following sometime later in the fall.

According to the press release, the protagonist isn't the only thing that's slightly different. "The new title is an exciting departure from previous games in the Professor Layton series as it is made up of a combination of smaller conundrums and puzzles that need to be solved in order to complete the overall mystery. This new format is going to appeal to existing Layton fans as well as attract a brand new audience."

The game is launching worldwide on iOS and Android on July 20.

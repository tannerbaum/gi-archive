  New Dragon Quest Builders Trailer Lays Out Its Constructive Premise

Dragon Quest Builders is a spinoff of the popular RPG series that lets players build and customize their own town while experiencing light action-RPG elements. It's been described as Minecraft, but with Dragon Quest, and for good reason – it's like Minecraft, but with Dragon Quest. If you need more to go on, however, Square Enix has released a new trailer that breaks down the game's various elements.
Players take on the role of the builder, a legendary figure with the ability to shape the world. The evil Dragonlord has made a mess of things, and you have to help the survivors rebuild and eventually take on the forces of evil. Also, it is completely adorable.

  New Gameplay Today – Hitman 2's New York Location: The Bank






            Hitman 2 has a new level today, set in a New York bank. In other words, Leo has an excuse to fire up Hitman 2 and play while he's on the clock. What a world! 

Kyle and I watch as Leo plays through the majority of the scenario for the first time. There's a fair amount of trialing and plenty of errors, but isn't that part of the fun? That's what we're hoping, at least! 

Hitman 2's New York expansion is out today on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, as part of the game's season pass.

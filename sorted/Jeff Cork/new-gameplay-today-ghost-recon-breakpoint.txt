  New Gameplay Today – Ghost Recon Breakpoint






            Ubisoft formally revealed Ghost Recon Breakpoint today, and managing editor Matt Bertz got to play it for himself. The latest entry diverts from the series in a few interesting ways, which Bertz explains to Leo and me in today's episode.

First, solo players won't be teaming up with A.I.-controlled operators. Instead, they'll have to rely on drones to pull of sync shots. Characters also take damage in more granular ways, with persistent injuries that affect mobility until the trauma is treated back at camp. Check out the episode above!

Ghost Recon Breakpoint is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this October. For more, make sure to read Bertz's full preview!

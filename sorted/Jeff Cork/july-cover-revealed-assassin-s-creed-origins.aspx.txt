  July Cover Revealed – Assassin's Creed Origins






The Assassin's Creed series has taken a year off since the release of Syndicate in 2015, and that additional time has given the team at Ubisoft Montreal a chance to realize its bold vision for the franchise. The Black Flag team pushed the series in new directions with its pirate-flavored entry, and their "nothing is sacred" approach is even more evident in Origins. Combat has been reimagined, navigation is tweaked, and foundational elements like Eagle Vision are taking on surprising new forms. We visited Montreal to get hands-on time with the game and talk to its creators, and our cover story packs in plenty of exclusive details within its 14 pages.

The game is set in ancient Egypt, which the team says has consistently been requested by fans. You take on the role of Bayek, a warden who will form the Brotherhood of Assassins. Thanks to a deeper focus on RPG and loot systems, you can shape the character in unprecedented ways. If you want to remain hidden and strike when it's safe, you can do that. Or you can focus on melee attacks and come in swinging. Regardless of your playstyle, you are accompanied by your faithful eagle companion, Senu, who you can guide to get a better sense of your surroundings.

In addition, watch for 10 full pages of info on Bungie's anticipated Destiny 2. We visited the developer for a full day of hands-on demos, spending time exploring one of the new destinations, trying out the new subclasses, and asking questions of the development leads, and came away with new insight (and screenshots) to share.
That's not all that's in our July issue. Think you know your games? Andrew Reiner's feature 25 Fun Facts You Probably Didn't Know will put your knowledge to the test. Elise Favis explores what it's like to develop games with your significant other in her feature. We also interview Giant Sparrow's Ian Dallas to learn more about What Remains of Edith Finch and the studio as a whole. That's in addition to hands-on previews with Ever Oasis, Hey! Pikmin, and many more.

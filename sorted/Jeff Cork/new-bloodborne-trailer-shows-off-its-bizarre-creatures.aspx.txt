From Software's latest creation, Bloodborne, is coming to the PlayStation 4 next week. It builds off the notoriously unforgiving gameplay from the studio's Souls series, though it's shifting away from dark fantasy to a Lovecraftian nightmare. A new trailer starts with shots of a few comparatively mundane enemies, but the creature designs quickly go off the rails â€“ in a good way.
It's one thing to take on werewolves, giant humanoids, and spiders. We've all done that before. Bloodborne's menagerie gets weird, as you can see in the clip below. That tentacled beast near the end is a particular highlight. Or are they eels? Who even knows anymore?

Bloodborne is coming exclusively to the PS4 on March 24.

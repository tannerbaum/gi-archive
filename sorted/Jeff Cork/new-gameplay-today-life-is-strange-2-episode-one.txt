  New Gameplay Today – Life Is Strange 2: Episode One






            Life is Strange 2's first full episode is out tomorrow, giving players a chance to meet new characters and explore new places in a storyline that may or may not be connected to Dontnod's original game. Elise took the reins in today's NGT, making a variety of decisions that left Leo and me in stunned disbelief. Life lesson: Keep your Halloween candy away from Elise is all I'm saying.

In addition to chowing down on ill-gotten candy, Elise's version of Daniel Diaz is all business, methodically picking up the items he needs for a night of teen partying. Daniel does take a moment to sketch his room, but other than that, he's all business. If you have trouble tracking down any of the items in the introductory section, consider this an in-depth walkthrough?

Life is Strange 2's first episode is available Sept. 27 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Darksiders III






            We've experienced what post-apocalyptic Earth is like via War and Death, but now it's Pestilence's Famine's Fury's turn! Kyle takes us on a quick tour of Darksiders III, highlighting what makes the new horseman different and also taking down a big ol' gross boss.

In today's NGT, you can see Fury's traversal options, a couple of her body transformations, and also see why Kyle's comparisons to the game being like Dark Souls are completely on point so don't get mad about it, all right?

Darksiders III is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 27.

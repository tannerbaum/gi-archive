  New Gameplay Today – Cadence of Hyrule - Crypt Of The NecroDancer Featuring the Legend of Zelda






            What are you doing for the next five minutes? Why not watch some new gameplay from Cadence of Hyrule – Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring the Legend of Zelda? Imran didn't waste that precious time trying to say the entirety of the game's title. No! Instead, he shared new footage showing his tragic lack of rhythm. Oh well!

Brace Yourself Games released the original Crypt of the Necrodancer came out about four years ago, which makes revisiting it almost as strange as injecting a bunch of Zelda characters and tunes into the rhythm/action game. That pales in comparison to the weirdness of its lengthy title (dial it back, guys?) and Nintendo's insistence that we only show five minutes of the game, divided into one-minute slices. What a cool way to show something off, right?!

Cadence of Hyrule – Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring the Legend of Zelda is coming to the Switch sometime soon.

  New Gameplay Today – Red Dead Redemption II






            Red Dead Redemption is officially out tomorrow, marking the release of one of (if not the) most highly anticipated games of 2018. We wanted to show off the game, while also respecting players who are avoiding story spoilers. With that in mind, we embarked on an hour-long trip through Red Dead II's open world – steering clear of any and all scripted missions. 

Even without those activities, we found plenty to do. Reiner was a good sport, gamely indulging just about every dumb request that Leo and I had for him. Animals were skinned. Arthur crouched on a cactus. Bad guys were killed and cremated. All the while, Reiner answers as many spoiler-free questions as he could. 

Red Dead Redemption II is out October 26 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

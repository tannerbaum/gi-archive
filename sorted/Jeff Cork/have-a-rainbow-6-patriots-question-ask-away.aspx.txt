  Have A Rainbow 6 Patriots Question? Ask Away






Last week, we revealed Ubisoft's Rainbox 6 Patriots to the world in our latest cover story. Since then, many of you have naturally had questions about the game and its controversial take on home-grown terrorism. Now's your chance to do something about that.
We'll take your questions straight to the team at Ubisoft Montreal and get the answers you crave. Of course, you have to ask them first. If you have any lingering questions about the game, put 'em in the comments section below. We'll address them in a special-edition Game Informer podcast later in the month.
Get to work!

Disney Infinity


  Combat In The Toy Box




Disney released a pair of trailers for its upcoming Disney Infinity just a week ago, and they're back with more. This time, the focus is on combat.
Think of the clip below as a sort of mash-up bash-up. The action is set in the game's freeform toy box mode, which means you're going to see familiar faces teaming up in unfamiliar ways. Don't worry – they're made out of plastic, so nobody is going to be (permanently) hurt.

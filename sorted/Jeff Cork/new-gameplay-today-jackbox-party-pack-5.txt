  New Gameplay Today â€“ Jackbox Party Pack 5






            Jackbox Games' latest party pack is coming out next week, which gives us an excuse to round up GI's party people and play through a bunch of fun stuff. Check out today's NGT for a sampler of each of the bundle's five games. Don't worry: We exited each game before Kyle could lose and throw a fit that would ruin it for everyone else. Whew!

We've got a full crew this episode, including Kyle, Jeff Marchiafava, Ben Hanson, interns Jill and J.P., Leo Vader, and me. Over the course of about an hour, we match wits (and embarrass ourselves) with some You Don't Know Jack: Full Stream trivia; devise fiendish scenarios in Split the Room; spit fire in Mad Verse City; pitch our best products in Patently Stupid; and play Zeeple Dome for a few seconds. Seriously, Zeeple Dome ain't great.

Jackbox Party Pack 5 is available October 17 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, and mobile.

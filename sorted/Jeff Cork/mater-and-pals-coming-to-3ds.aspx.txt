Cars 2: The Video Game


  Mater And Pals Coming To 3DS




Cars 2: The Video game was a surprisingly fun little racer, and it seems as though it inspired plenty of instances of that particular f word. The game is now blazing its way to the Nintendo 3DS, and Disney is marking the occasion with a new trailer.
If nothing else, the clip shows that reviewers may want to learn a few new synonyms. Look for Cars 2 on the 3DS this holiday season. It's already out for the Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC.

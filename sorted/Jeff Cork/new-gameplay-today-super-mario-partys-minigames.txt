  New Gameplay Today – Super Mario Party's Minigames






            Wait, where are you going?! We're playing Super Mario Party games in today's NGT! We've got 15 minutes to play with, and rather than waste it on die rolls and all that nonsense, we're blasting through as many minigames as humanly possible. 

Brian Shea reviewed the game for us, and he provides a curated Super Mario Party experience for Ben Hanson, Jeff Marchiafava, Leo Vader, and me. There's nothing but the best for us (and you!). Except that one tablecloth game, which I am convinced is rigged/broken.

Super Mario Party is available October 5 on the Switch.

  New Gameplay Today – EDF: Iron Rain






            This one's for all the bug haters out there. The latest game in the EDF series, Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain is out next week, and unsurprisingly it features an impressive amount of bug-blasting action. Reiner and I joined forces against the invaders in today's special co-op episode, while Leo sat back in the booth and asked all kinds of great questions. 

We're both pretty big fans of the series, and we spend a fair bit of time explaining what's different about this spinoff (the loot loop, for one thing), while knocking down buildings and turning gigantic ants and spiders into lifeless husks. It's EDF, after all.

Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain is coming to PlayStation 4 on April 11.

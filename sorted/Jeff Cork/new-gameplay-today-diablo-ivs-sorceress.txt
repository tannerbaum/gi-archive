  New Gameplay Today – Diablo IV's Sorceress






            A few days ago, we showed off Diablo IV's barbarian, highlighting what the big bruiser brings to the battlefield. What if you prefer something a bit more civilized than smashing things around at melee range? Well, have we got a sorceress for you! In today's NGT, we focus on the returning magic-using class, showing off her elemental prowess.

The sorceress wields fire, lightning, and cold-based attacks, just like her Diablo II counterpart. She's a solid pick for people who want to hang back and pick enemies apart at range, though some of her abilities let her get up close, too. Check it out!

  First Dev Diary Lays Out The Game's Thrilling Horror/Survival Hybrid

Hunt: Showdown is a satisfying twist on the survival genre, pitting multiple players against common A.I.-controlled threats, leaving the decision of when to turn on other players up to the two-person teams. Crytek has released the first dev diary for the upcoming game, which tracks the twisted path that Hunt: Showdown took during development, while also showcasing what makes it unique.
The game's set in a gothic horror-inspired version of the Old West, with five teams of cowboys scouring the map for clues about their ultimate prize's location. Telegraph your location by speaking too loudly to your friend or making too much noise, and other players may learn your location. Whether they decide to leave you alone or add you to their kill list is up to them. Once the main monster is slain, the hunters have to banish the creature's wicked soul before fleeing the map. 
Take a look at the video below to see how this dynamic plays out.

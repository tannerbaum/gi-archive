  New Gameplay Today – Generation Zero Beta






            Avalanche is known for its chaotic, explosion-filled open-world games such as Mad Max and the Just Cause series. Its independently released Generation Zero is a bit different, in that it trades anarchic thrills for atmospheric chills (hey, that rhymes!). Brian Shea got into the game's closed beta, and he shares some of his initial thoughts in today's NGT.

First things first: Shea claims that he was trying to make a dig at Kyle with his custom character, but that was a big swing and a miss. Only Leo and I can be mean to Kyle, so we apologize if it hurt anyone's feelings. Even Kyle. Secondly, the game features an alternate-reality Sweden, in which the people have disappeared and robots have taken over. The overall tone is eerily quiet, save for some relentless dogbots, which pose a real problem to Shea. In his defense, he's just starting out so his guns aren't exactly powerful. Also, he misses just so, so many times.

Generation Zero is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC next year.

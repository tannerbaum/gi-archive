  New Gameplay Today – Apex Legends






            Respawn and EA had a double-whammy of a surprise today, with the announcement and launch of a new shooter set in the Titanfall universe. Does Apex Legends add anything of note to the battle-royale genre? After spending some extensive time with it, Javy seems to think so.

Apex Legends has several significant twists to the formula, including archetypical hero characters with special abilities; a focus on three-person squads; and, of course, its ties to Titanfall. Javy is a big fan of the main series, and he has a lot to say about this spinoff. 

Apex Legends is available now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

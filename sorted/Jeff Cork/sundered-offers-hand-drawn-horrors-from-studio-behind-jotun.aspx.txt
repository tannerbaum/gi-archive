Thunder Lotus Games, the indie studio behind the game Jotun, has revealed its second game. Sundered is a procedurally generated platformer with dark horror themes and massive boss battles, capped off with gorgeous hand-drawn art and animation.
Players explore a horrific world as Eshe, a wanderer trapped in a series of mysterious caverns. According to the developer, the game's been designed with replayability in mind – from the changing world to player choices with in-game consequences. Take a look at the trailer below to get a sense of what you're up against.

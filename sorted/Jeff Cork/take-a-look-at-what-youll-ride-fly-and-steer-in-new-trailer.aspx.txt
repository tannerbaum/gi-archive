Warner Interactive has released a new trailer for the Lego City Undercover remaster, which focuses on the various vehicles you'll use to fly, drive, and steer around (and above) Lego City. 
Chase McCain and the rest of his crew have to get around somehow, and their little minifig legs can only move so quickly. Fortunately, there are more than 100 different vehicles to control, from motorcycles to helicopters – and plenty in between. Take a look at the trailer below to get a sample.
Sorry, this video is not available
The clip doesn't show off any of the game's new split-screen action, but you can see that in our earlier preview.
Lego City Undercover is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on April 4.

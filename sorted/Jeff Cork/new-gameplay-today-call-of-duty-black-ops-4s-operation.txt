  New Gameplay Today – Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4's Operation Absolute Zero






            Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has a big update today on PlayStation 4. Operation Absolute Zero adds a bunch of new things to Blackout, including a new armored vehicle, a fancy new yacht, and more. Dan Tack, Andrew Reiner, Ben Hanson, and I check out some of the changes (autumnal colors!) in today's NGT.

In addition to that other stuff, players will be able to earn several critically important emotes for their characters. You like sandwiches? How about rock/paper/scissors and/or dad dance moves? Watch today's episode for all this and much more. 

Operation Absolute Zero is available on PS4 today, and the free update will be arriving on Xbox One and PC on December 18.

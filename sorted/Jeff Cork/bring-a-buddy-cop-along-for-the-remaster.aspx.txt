Lego City Undercover was an early Wii U game that, in spite of its many charms, didn't seem to get the shot it deserved. It remains one of TT Fusion's most beloved titles, and now the studio is hoping to share it with more players with a remastered version. In addition to coming to PlayStation and Xbox platforms for the first time, the updated Lego City Undercover delivers a feature that was conspicuously absent the first time around: As a new trailer shows, Chase McCain will be able to clean up the mean streets of Lego City with a buddy by his side.

That's right – Lego City Undercover is getting co-op. Players will be able to tackle the game with a friend, via dynamic split-screen. Take a look at the clip below for a few shots of what it looks like, as well as a few of Chase's many unusual costumes and disguises.

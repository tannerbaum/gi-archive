  New Gameplay Today – Outriders' Pyromancer Class






            People Can Fly's upcoming RPG/shooter lets players pick between four different character classes, each with its own unique skillset and general combat role. Today, we're looking at the Pyromancer, which is an archetype based on (you guessed it) setting things ablaze. 

In today's NGT, Leo and I walk through some of our experiences playing with a Pyromancer character during our visit to People Can Fly's studio in Warsaw, and share some info about what the class brings to the combat arena. It's not just fire, you know? They can also turn people into weird, ashy statue things. Look, just watch the video, OK?

Outriders is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox One Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2020. For more video features on the game, including our rapid-fire interview, visit our hub page by clicking the banner below.

WWE 2K17


  WWE 2K17 Trailer Demystifies The Controls




WWE 2K17 comes out tomorrow. Multiplayer is a big part of the game, and it's likely that at least one person in the group hasn't been keeping pace with the series as much as the rest of the crew. Publisher 2K has released a new video aimed at getting those players up to speed, so they can jump into the action as quickly as possible.
The video covers everything from basic in-ring movement to a pretty in-depth look at both of the game's different submission-move options. If you have a friend who follows the WWE but not the games, and they're going to be playing with you in the near future, you may want to save yourself a little aggravation and point them toward this video.

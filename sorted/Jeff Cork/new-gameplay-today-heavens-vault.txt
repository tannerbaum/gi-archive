  New Gameplay Today â€“ Heaven's Vault






            Heaven's Vault is an upcoming adventure game from Inkle, the makers of 80 Days. There's a common theme of traveling, though archaeologist Aliya Elasra isn't taking a ride based on a wager. Instead, she's in it for knowledge!

Elise joins Leo and me on a mini journey of our own in today's episode of NGT. We do our best to help Aliya decipher ancient inscriptions, though it becomes clear that I probably don't have much of a future in that field. My poor guidance aside, Heaven's Vault has a neat puzzle hook, where you use contextual clues to translate glyphs and, eventually, a language. Plus, there's a weird-looking robot named Six. What more do you want?!

Heaven's Vault is coming to PlayStation 4 and PC (via Steam) on April 16.

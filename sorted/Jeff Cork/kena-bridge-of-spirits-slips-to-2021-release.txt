  Kena: Bridge Of Spirits Slips To 2021 Release






If, like us, you're excited to get your hands on Kena: Bridge of Spirits, we have a little bittersweet news: According to a statement from Ember Lab, the game is slipping from a holiday 2020 release to the first quarter of 2021. The studio says the decision was made for the sake of the game's quality, as well as for the well-being of the team. 

Here's the official statement, in its entirety:

The Ember Lab Team is overwhelmed and humbled by the positive response and outpouring of support for Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Your kind words and excitement for the game have been an inspiration to the team. This year has brought many challenges and our transition to working from home has caused development to move slower than we hoped. For this reason, we have made the difficult decision to delay the release of Kena: Bridge of Spirits to Q1, 2021. We have not made this decision lightly, but feel it is best for the game and well-being of the team. We will use this time to give the game the polish it deserves and deliver an experience that meets our vision and your expectations. We look forward to sharing more about Kena in the coming months and delivering an amazing experience early next year.  

It's certainly disappointing in the short term, but it's hard to argue with if it means a better game in the end and, less selfishly, if the delay makes it possible for the game to be completed and polished without burning out its staff.

  New Gameplay Today – Spyro Reignited Trilogy






            Insomniac's Spyro games gave PlayStation fans some much-needed platforming action back in the day. Decades later, Toys for Bob has revisited the first three games in the series and completely rebuilt them. How is Spyro Reignited Trilogy? Take a look and see for yourself in today's NGT!

Toys for Bob faithfully kept the placement of objects and secrets in these remakes, but gave the games a much-needed visual update. Visual flourishes like smoldering grass and unique dragons make it feel new, as Reiner points out, while Leo Vader is fixated on Spyro's lack of clothing. To each their own?

Spyro Reignited Trilogy is available November 13 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

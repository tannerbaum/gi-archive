  Killzone, Bulletstorm, De Blob--Weekly Roundup 2/21






This is a week that could make your wallet sore, if you're not careful. Shooter fans have two excellent options this week in Bulletstorm and Killzone 3. The Dreamcast Collection compilation gives retro fans a reason to cheer (though with only four games on it, don't feel the need to scream too loudly). Knights Action and de Blob 2 are also coming to stores. In other words, it's a pretty full release week. It's about time.

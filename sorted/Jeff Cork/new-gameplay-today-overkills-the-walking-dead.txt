  New Gameplay Today â€“ Overkill's The Walking Dead






            Overkill's The Walking Dead is out today in North America, so we thought we'd brave the walker-infested streets and see how it is. In short, it's a zombie game.

Dan Tack takes the sticks in today's episode, showing off the game's melee combat, defense construction, and zombie-slaying gunplay. It was his first time with the game, but he was a pro. Meanwhile, Reiner, Hanson, and I talked about the Walking Dead franchise as a whole, including my impassioned plea for him to not waste his time catching up on the show. Just doing my part.

Overkill's The Walking Dead is out today on PC, with PlayStation and Xbox One versions set for a February 6 release.

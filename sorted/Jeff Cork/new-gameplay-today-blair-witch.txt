  New Gameplay Today – Blair Witch






            Remember that Blair Witch game that Lionsgate Interactive revealed at Microsoft's E3 press conference? You know, the one with the guy and the flashlight and the dog? This one? All right! In today's NGT, Elise takes me and Leo through a virtual walk in the woods, sharing her impressions of the game and some exclusive footage from Bloober Team's upcoming horror game. 

True to the genre, your hero, Ellis, isn't armed to the teeth when he heads out into the woods. He's on a search for a missing child, which would make it a little weird. Also, it's a great way to make players feel vulnerable as they search for clues and catch glimpses of some things that are definitely not normal. Fortunately, he brought his dog, Bullet, along for the trip. Check out today's NGT to see what Bullet brings, aside from being a good boy for petting.

Blair Witch is coming to Xbox One and PC on August 30.

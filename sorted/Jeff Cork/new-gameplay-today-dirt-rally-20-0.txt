  New Gameplay Today â€“ Dirt Rally 2.0






            When it comes to racing games, Leo and I lean more toward the arcade end of the spectrum. Fortunately for us, Matt Kato is here to save the day when more sim-oriented titles are on hand. In today's episode, Kato takes us through a few races in Codemasters' upcoming Dirt Rally 2.0, somehow managing to answer our questions while still staying on the course. Amazing!

There's a lot to take in here, but Kato gamely answers all of our (possibly dumb) questions, including, "What is rally racing." Look. We're not afraid to dig in deep for our New Gameplay Today viewers.

Look for Dirt Rally 2.0 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 26.

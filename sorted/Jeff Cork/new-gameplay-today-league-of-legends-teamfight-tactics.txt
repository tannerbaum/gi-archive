  New Gameplay Today â€“ League of Legends: Teamfight Tactics






            It's a great time to be an auto-chess fan! Today, Riot Games put its take on the burgeoning genre into open beta, with the release of Teamfight Tactics. How is it? Dan Tack played a round for Leo and me to show off what it has to offer. Did he win? There's literally only way to find out! Sheesh!

Tack employed a number of pro-level strats here, including amassing a big bankroll and trying to sort out what exactly is going on with the game's weird character carousel. Seriously, what were they thinking with that thing? Anyway, it's a nice primer on the game, and you might even learn a thing or two!

Be sure to look at our episode on Dota Underlords here, to see what Valve is up to in the auto-chess space.

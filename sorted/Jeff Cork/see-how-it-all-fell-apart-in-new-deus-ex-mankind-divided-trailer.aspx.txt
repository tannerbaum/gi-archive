Deus Ex: Mankind Divided


  See How It All Fell Apart In New Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Trailer




Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is built around a future that might seem alien to us, with a world split between supporters and detractors of advanced medical prostheses known as augmentations, or augs. After a cataclysmic event caused some augmented people to temporarily lose control and go on violent rampages, many react with fear, hostility, and their own violence. A new live-action trailer for the game follows the events from the beginning, showing them from the perspective of a couple living in this increasingly uncertain world.
There's a lot of world-building to absorb here – particularly if you haven't played its predecessor, Deus Ex: Human Revolution – but the trailer does a good job of showing the paranoia that would likely grip people following such a disaster.

The video touches on it briefly, but if you're interested in learning more about why people wanted to get augmentations in the first place check out my feature. While visiting the studio for our cover story on the game, I asked the game's developers about the augmentations themselves, how much they cost people living in this universe, and more.

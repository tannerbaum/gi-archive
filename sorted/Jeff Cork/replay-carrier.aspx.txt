We've been playing sub-par survival-horror games for years now, and there's one game that fans have brought up time and time again: Carrier. OK, OK, we get it! Uncle! This week, we finally get around to playing the Dreamcast game as we search for our special December 31 Super Replay candidate to ring in 2016. Will this one make the cut? It's too early to say for sure, but take a look at our impressions in this new episode.

Carrier has a tough act to follow, coming on the heels of last week's Deep Fear episode. The game definitely has what it takes when it comes to bad acting, poor cinematography, and weird pacing, but does it have that special Ingredient X that we're looking for? Take a look at the episode and let us know what you think in the comments. Tim, Reiner, Dan Tack, and I had a lot of fun with the game, but we're also getting paid.

We follow up our look at Carrier with what could be a recurring second segment, and some pass-the-controller action with another old-school game. Tack's eyes lit up when he heard about our pick – is he a crazy person? Signs point to "yes."

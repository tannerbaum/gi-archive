  Get A Little Taste Of Obsidian's Grounded In New Demo






We've been pretty excited about Obsidian's upcoming survival game Grounded – enough that we put it on our cover. We were able to play the game for several hours, getting a sense of how its micro-scaled setup affects building, combat, and more. If you're curious about the game, starting today you'll be able to check it out for yourself on Xbox One and PC.

The 30-minute demo doesn't include multiplayer, but it should give you plenty of time to figure out exactly what the developers are aiming for. It's available for registered Xbox Insiders as well as those of you who are participating in the Steam Game Festival. The demo is available from today until June 22.

Grounded's Game Preview and early access versions will launch next month, on July 28.

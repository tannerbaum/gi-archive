  New Gameplay Today – Shakedown: Hawaii






            Nearly seven years ago, Vblank's Retro City Rampage gave players a chance to explore a city in a retro-style GTA throwback. Now the indie studio is back with Shakedown: Hawaii, a game that puts its out-of-touch antihero on a mission to take back Hawaii from his competitors, one extortion attempt and poorly developed scam at a time.

Leo takes the sticks (dual sticks, actually, as he discovers late in the episode), while Kyle and I watch in stunned amazement. Is he some kind of chosen one or something!? 

Shakedown: Hawaii is coming to PlayStation 4, Switch, Vita, and PC (via the Epic Games Store) on May 7.

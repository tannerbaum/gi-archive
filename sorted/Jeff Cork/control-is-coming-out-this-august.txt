  Control Is Coming Out This August






We've been releasing new features and videos about Remedy's latest game, Control, for the past few weeks, but one nagging detail has remained elusive: When the heck is this thing coming out, anyway? We knew it was coming sometime this summer, but we didn't know the exact date.

Today, an entry on Microsoft's online store accidentally revealed the release date, which we have confirmed with Remedy. What are you doing this August? More specifically, what are you doing August 27? That's when the game will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

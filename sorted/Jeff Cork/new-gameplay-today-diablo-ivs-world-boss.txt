  New Gameplay Today – Diablo IV's World Boss






            One of the more interesting things about Diablo IV is its open-world nature. Rather than go on adventures in large, discrete zones, players will now navigate a massive connected landscape. Before you put on your hiking boots, know that this world is also home to some nasty raid-style bosses that will require a bit of teamwork. In today's episode, we show off what it's like to take on one of these bosses, Ashava, with a large group.

Take a look at the clip above to see nearly a dozen heroes battling Ashava simultaneously, or below to watch it without commentary. As you can see, he has a pretty long reach – perfect for wiping an entire group, if members aren't careful. Fortunately, you can clip his wings a bit by filling up his stagger meter. We get into that and more in this NGT. Enjoy!

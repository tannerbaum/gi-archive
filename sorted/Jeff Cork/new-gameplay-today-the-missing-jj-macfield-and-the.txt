  New Gameplay Today – The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories 






            Swery's latest game is The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories, and it's as weird as its title is long. In it, you play as the titular J.J. on the titular Island of Memories, and soon discover that you have mysterious new powers.

Fine. They're not super mysterious. Basically, you can get dismembered, injured, and otherwise broken and use that trauma to navigate puzzles. Need to knock down a crate? Sever a limb and toss it at the box! Want to flip gravity? Break your neck! (We don't fully get that one. What can you do?) Ben Reeves joins me and Leo in this episode of NGT and shows why he ended up liking it as much as he did.

The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is available today on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Read our review here.

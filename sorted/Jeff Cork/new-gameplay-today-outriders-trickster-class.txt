  New Gameplay Today â€“ Outriders' Trickster Class






            After being exposed to a mysterious force called The Anomaly, humans face a variety of different fates. They might be torn apart, atom by atom. On the other extreme, they might turn into gods. Today, we're focusing on one of the luckier ones, those who become Tricksters. These character archetypes can teleport around the world in People Can Fly's shooter/RPG, turning what might otherwise be a mundane gunfight in an exhilarating game of hide and seek. And then headshot.

Leo and I visited People Can Fly's studio in Warsaw, and you can hear details about our hands-on experiences in today's episode. Leo played almost exclusively with this class, and he had a lot of thoughts. In addition to learning more about the Trickster, you can get a sense of how missions are structured in Outriders' hub-and-spoke-based world.

Outriders is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox One Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2020. For more video features on the game, including our rapid-fire interview, visit our hub page by clicking the banner below.

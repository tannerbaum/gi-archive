  New Gameplay Today – Red Dead Online's Battle Royale Mode






            Red Dead Online has gotten its first big update for the year, which adds the new Gun Rush mode to the game. While the name might not be immediately familiar, all you need to know is that it's basically battle royale. Leo seized the opportunity (and the controller) to show Kyle and me why he's such a notorious online gunslinger in a pair of solo matches and one team match.

While the mode does support up to 32 players, there weren't many people playing at the time of this recording. Judging from how Leo performed, however, there wouldn't have been many people playing after running into him, either. Look, he's really good and we're just so proud of him, OK?

MODOK is undeniably one of the best villains in the entire Marvel universe. It only stands to reason that the supergenius – an acronym for "Mobile Organism Designed Only for Killing" – would zoom over to Lego Marvel Super Heroes and show the rest of the bad guys how it's done.
Here's what Arthur Parsons, the game's director, has to say about the mighty MODOK, as he appears in the game: 
"Doctor Doom is scouring the planet looking for the cosmic Lego bricks from the Silver Surfer's board and enlists the help of A.I.M., who supply him with a purpose-built ship, the Doom Tanker. This navigates the seas looking for bricks and is crewed by A.I.M. Goons under the jurisdiction of MODOK. So as the player is tracking the cosmic Lego bricks – when they least expect it – MODOK turns up to rain on their parade. As sinister as ever, MODOK assaults the player and tries to slow them down allowing Doctor Doom to escape in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Research Submarine."
MODOK is no stranger to video games, appearing as a quiz-wielding baddie in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance and a playable fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Considering the game's 100-plus character roster, we wouldn't be surprised to see him as both an adversary and a playable character.

In addition to MODOK, we've got the first look at the villains poster, below. It features Green Goblin, Venom, Magneto, Bullseye, Doctor Octopus, Kingpin, Mystique, Doctor Doom, Loki, Abomination, and, of course, MODOK.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ The World Ends With You: Final Remix






            Square Enix is bringing its DS RPG The World Ends with You over to Nintendo Switch this fall, in what it's calling the Final Remix. Kyle and Suriel take us on a refreshingly brief tour of the game, in which Kyle has the scorching-hot take that the game's music is good. Yikes!

Full disclosure: I was very mean to Kyle in this video, because it wasn't his fault that his character kept beeping during the fights and it looked like he was just standing around doing nothing for a while. In fact, the beeping was part of the character build that was set up for the demo, and Kyle was actually playing possum on purpose. Or something like that!

The World Ends with You: Final Remix is coming to the Switch on October 12.

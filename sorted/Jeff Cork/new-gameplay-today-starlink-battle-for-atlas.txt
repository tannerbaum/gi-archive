  New Gameplay Today – Starlink: Battle For Atlas 






            Back at E3, we got our hands on Ubisoft's entry in the toys-to-life genre, a sci-fi themed game called Starlink: Battle for Atlas. Today, we're taking another look at the title, with more of a focus on all the plastic bits. 

Matt Miller takes Kyle, Leo, and me on a journey through space on the Switch version of the game. As Miller points out, that's probably the one to get, considering that it's the only way you'll have access to all the StarFox content. We also get a look at how the ships can be reconfigured on the fly, a couple of the pilots (including some kind of alien gasbag), and how the planetary exploration works.

Starlink: Battle for Atlas is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on October 16.

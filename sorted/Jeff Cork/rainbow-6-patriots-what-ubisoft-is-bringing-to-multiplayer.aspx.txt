  Ubisoft Montreal Talks Rainbow 6 Patriots Multiplayer






Online multiplayer is as popular as ever, with new entries in the Call of Duty and Battlefield series fighting for players' time. It's been a while since we've seen a new Rainbow Six game, but Ubisoft Montreal is confident that it will deliver what players are expecting and much more with Rainbow 6: Patriots. Watch our exclusive video to get a taste of what's to come.
Join us as we talk with Simon Larouche (lead designer, multiplayer) and David Sears (creative director) about how player expectations have evolved over the past few years, and how Ubisoft Montreal plans to meet them. We also explore the game's new Sandtable (see the concept art above), which lets players familiarize themselves with maps and devise strategies outside of matches.

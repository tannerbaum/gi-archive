Batman: The Telltale Series – Episode 1


  Get Your First Look At Batman: The Telltale Series In Episode One Trailer




Telltale is taking on another big license with its adaptation of Batman. The studio is shaping its own story with Batman: The Telltale Series, not adapting an existing storyline that players are familiar with. That doesn't mean you won't be seeing a recognizable roster of characters, however. A trailer for the game's first episode has just released, and you'll notice more than a few well-known faces from the Dark Knight's past.
The studio showed off the first half hour of gameplay from the episode at E3, and you can read our beat-by-beat impressions of that demo in our earlier preview. If some of the voices in the trailer sound familiar, it's not just you. The cast includes Troy Baker as Bruce Wayne, Travis Willingham as Harvey Dent, Erin Yvette as Vicki Vale, Enn Reitel as Alfred Pennyworth, Murphy Guyer as James Gordon, Richard McGonagle as Carmine Falcone, and Laura Bailey as Selina Kyle.

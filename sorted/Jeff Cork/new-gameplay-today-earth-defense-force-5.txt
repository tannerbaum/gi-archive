  New Gameplay Today â€“ Earth Defense Force 5






            Earth Defense Force (or "EDF" as its close friends like to call it) is something of an acquired taste. Yes, its visuals, voice acting, animation, and overall action are at times lacking, but there's something undeniably charming and fun about the alien bug-blasting series. We got a build of EDF 5 in the office, so I wrangled up fellow apologist Joe Juba for some split-screen co-op action. Warning: This NGT features giant ants. They are just so big. And they are ants. So if you don't like ants, you have been warned.

This one's coming in fairly hot, so don't expect a contemplative meditation on the nature of EDF and its relation to the greater universe. Maybe don't even expect a certain player 2 to fully understand what the buttons do, either. At the end of the day though, it's shooting bugs and picking up loot. Got it? Got it.

Earth Defense Force 5 is coming to PlayStation 4 later this year.

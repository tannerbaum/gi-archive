  New Gameplay Today – Psychonauts 2






            Psychonauts 2 takes place right after the VR game Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin, but Double Fine's Tim Schafer says you don't have to play it to understand what's going on in the sequel (perhaps that's for the best). Judging from what we see in today's NGT, it's pretty clear what's going on. Dr. Loboto, Raz, teeth, figments – you know, Psychonauts stuff.

Leo and I are joined by Elise and Kyle, as we watch through some footage Double Fine provided of a recent demo. There's a fair bit of exposition at the start, but don't worry. There IS gameplay here, or else we'd be lying to you! And we'd never do that!

For more on Psychonauts 2, check out Imran's recent preview. Elise also talked to Schafer at E3 and learned what Microsoft's recent acquisition of the company holds for his studio's future. You can read that here.

Six years ago, People Can Fly unleashed Bulletstorm on the world, a gonzo shooter that gave players a mayhem-filled moveset and the freedom to lay waste to enemies in over-the-top ways. The story may have gotten lost in the shuffle, but it was surprisingly OK. With the upcoming remaster, Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition, publisher Gearbox wants to remind you about that story, and they're doing it in a surprisingly humorless trailer.
Take a look at the clip below to see Grayson Hunt navigate a sci-fi conspiracy, as well as a few shots of some of the game's bigger set pieces. And while you're watching it, keep in mind that this is still the game that rewards you for shooting crotches, kicking bad guys into spike traps, and turning crowds of enemies into clouds of red goo.

In addition to cleaning up the visuals since its 2011 release, the Full Clip Edition includes 4K support on PC and PS4 Pro, all of the original game's DLC, and a new-game plus Overkill Mode.
Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on April 7.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Breach






            QC Games' debut release, Breach, just hit early access, and we wanted to show it off. There's a lot to love about it, including its big roster of highly customizable heroes, strategic options, and co-op action. Dan Tack gives it his best in this episode of NGT, highlighting why it's something you might want to keep an eye on.

One of the game's most intriguing aspects is its asymmetrical battles, which pit teams of five heroes against another player, who plays as the veil demon. The solo player can use traps, inhabit enemies, and generally work to make life miserable for everyone else. Watch the video to see just how miserable it can get!

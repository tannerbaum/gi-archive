  New Gameplay Today – Fist Of The North Star: Lost Paradise






            Fist of the North Star is a manga series about a guy who walks around after the apocalypse and makes bad guys explode by tapping into the power of acupuncture. Sensing opportunity, the fine folks at Sega decided to design a new game around it all, and here we are. As Kenshiro says, "You are already dead!" Just run with it, OK?

Brian Shea joins us in this episode, laying waste to a distressing number of villains. If you're squeamish, fair warning: This game is super gross, with deaths that are kind of like when the guy in RoboCop got splashed with toxic waste and creamed by that car – but with more blood. In other news, Leo and I are taking acupuncture classes online.

If you prefer to watch the same gameplay except without the commentary, look down one inch!

Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise is coming to PlayStation 4 on October 2.

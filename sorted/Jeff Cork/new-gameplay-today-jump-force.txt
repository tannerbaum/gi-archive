  New Gameplay Today – Jump Force






            People like anime, right? How about manga? In today's episode of NGT, we show off one of the most anime-ing-est games around, Jump Force. Kyle walks me and special guest Ben Hanson through a few bouts and a couple of cutscenes. 

As you can see, the mash-up battles are fast and filled with references that only true anime fans will get. At least that's what I'm going with, since absolutely none of it made any sense to me. Look, Kyle and Hanson are way more clued into this scene than I am. Fortunately, they do most of the talking.

Jump Force is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 15.

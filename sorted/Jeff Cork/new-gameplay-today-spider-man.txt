  New Gameplay Today â€“ Spider-Man






            Reiner is a big fan of Spider-Man, the character, as well as the comics and movies that star the web-crawling hero. As it turns out, he's also quite fond of Insomniac's upcoming game, too. Why? Well tune in to our latest NGT to see. Short answer: He thinks it's fun and cool.

Reiner takes on a story mission, and also tackles a few street crimes while roaming around (above?) the streets of New York City. And, he does it all while dressed in what is objectively one of the worst outfits we've seen in recent gaming. It's just so bad.

Spider-Man is available on PlayStation 4 on September 7.

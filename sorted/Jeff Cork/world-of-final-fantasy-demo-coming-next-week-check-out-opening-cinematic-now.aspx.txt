World of Final Fantasy


  World Of Final Fantasy Demo Coming Next Week, Check Out Opening Cinematic Now




Final Fantasy mashup World of Final Fantasy is coming to PlayStation 4 and Vita in a few weeks, but Square Enix is letting players get a little taste of the turn-based action ahead of time. A free playable demo is coming to the PlayStation Store next week, and the publisher has also released the game's animated intro for your viewing pleasure.
The demo will be available October 17, featuring Reynn and Lann in their Lilikin and Jiant forms (sound it out, it makes sense. Kind of). Players can meet up with Cloud, Lightning, and Squall in the demo, and if you complete it you can battle and capture the Magitek Armor P for use in the full version.

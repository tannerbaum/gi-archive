  New Gameplay Today – Risk Of Rain 2






            Hopoo Games made a surprise announcement during Gearbox's PAX panel this afternoon, revealing that Risk of Rain 2 is now available in Steam Early Access. Upon hearing this news, Leo ran to the studio so quickly that he left a flaming trail like that one part in Back to the Future. He really wanted to play this one, apparently.

Was it worth the carpet damage? Does he live up to his reputation as the office's best roguelike player? "Yes" and "maybe?" Look. Sometimes the RNG doesn't work out in your favor, it wasn't Leo's fault, etc. Regardless of how long he may or may not last in some runs, you'll get a look at a ton of the game's fun weapons and items, which stack for some interesting effects. And that's a promise!

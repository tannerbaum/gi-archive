  New Gameplay Today – Call Of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game






            Lovecraftian horror is a particularly rich source of inspiration for the game industry, and Focus Home Interactive taps right into the mother lode. Its upcoming survival horror/adventure game Call of Cthulhu: The Official Game uses H.P. Lovecraft's original short story as the starting point for a creepy adventure, where nothing is as it seems – unless it is? Look, it's complicated. 

Reiner is on the sticks, showing off some of the crime-scene investigations and conversations, while Lovecraft enthusiast Matt Miller asks questions and Leo and I look on in (Lovecraftian) horror. 

Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 30.

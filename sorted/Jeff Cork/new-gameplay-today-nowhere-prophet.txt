  New Gameplay Today – Nowhere Prophet






            No More Robots just announced that it will be publishing Nowhere Prophets, the new digital card game from Sharkbomb Studios. It's set in a post-apocalyptic future (with delicate notes of cyberpunk), where you play as the leader of a ragtag group of survivors. At least, that's what I'm told – Leo scrolls through the text so awfully fast in today's episode.

As a prophet, it's up to you to make decisions that keep your burgeoning convoy safe, while adding to their numbers. Play your cards right (AHAHAHA!), and your decisions will lead to prosperity, earning food, batteries, and other valuable resources to keep things running smoothly. Even if you make all the right calls, you're going to end up fighting in Nowhere Prophets' tactical battles. Thankfully for us, Leo and his big brain are leading this train. Toot toot!

The game is available now on itch.io First Access, or look for it on Steam this summer.

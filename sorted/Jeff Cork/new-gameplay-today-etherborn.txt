  New Gameplay Today â€“ Etherborn






            Etherborn is a weird puzzle game where you take a translucently skinned character on a gravity-defying journey. What is this, some kind of indie game? Yes. Yes, it is.

Altered Matter gave us an exclusive look at one of the game's levels, and Leo spent an evening mastering it. Fortunately for us, he does a great job pretending to be stuck on one part, so I can swoop in and feel like a hero/contributor for the first time in my life. Thanks, Leo!

Etherborn is coming to Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC this spring.

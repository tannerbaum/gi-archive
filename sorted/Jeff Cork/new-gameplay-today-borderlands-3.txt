  New Gameplay Today â€“ Borderlands 3






            Imran just got back from Borderlands 3's first hands-on event, where he played through a couple of missions with the new vault hunters. How was it? Funny you should ask! He sat down with Leo and me and walked us through some of the highlights.

When we say it's more Borderlands, it's not necessarily a dig. As Imran explains, Borderlands 3 is a refined version of what came before it, with interesting quality-of-life improvements (instanced loot and level scaling!) and other tweaks (alt-fire modes!). Watch the video, OK?!

For more on Borderlands 3, check out Imran's complete preview.

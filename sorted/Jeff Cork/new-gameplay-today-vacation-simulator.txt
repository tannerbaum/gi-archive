  New Gameplay Today – Vacation Simulator






            VR owners can take a break from the daily grind with today's release of Vacation Simulator. The follow-up to Job Simulator is as silly as its predecessor, as Kyle ably demonstrates. Also, he whacks the mic stand about a million times because he can't really see what's going on back here in "the real world." Oh well!

Kyle takes Leo and I on three quick excursions, where he dresses a snowman, shoots acorns at signs, and then draws a picture of a pretty lady and turns it into a waffle. Vacations, right?!

Vacation Simulator is out today on SteamVR and Oculus, with a PlayStation VR release coming (appropriately enough) this summer.

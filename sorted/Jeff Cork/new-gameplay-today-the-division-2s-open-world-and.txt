  New Gameplay Today – The Division 2's Open World And Endgame






            Last month, we showed you how The Division 2 was changing up its dark-zone formula. Today, we've got a look at its open world and endgame content. 

I got to spend several hours playing the game, and Leo and I have plenty to say about it – from its opening salvo on the White House lawn to a mission against heavily armed soldiers in the National Air and Space Museum. 

The Division 2 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 15.

  New Gameplay Today – Gato Roboto






            Doinksoft takes the "Metroid" in "Metroidvania," and essentially tosses out the "vania" part. Look, what we're trying to say here is that Gato Roboto is a lot like Metroid. Metroid II, if we're being specific. Check it out!

We've got a full crew this episode, with Ben Reeves and Kyle Hilliard joining the classic Leo and Jeff (that's me!) lineup. Ben does a pretty solid job overall, taking out a boss with ease and then going out of his way to show us what happens when our kitty hero dies. Oh yeah! You play as a cat in a robot suit! Just watch, OK?

Gato Roboto is coming to Switch and PC this year.

  Latest Dev Diary Sheds Light On How The Game's Thrilling Encounters Are Built

Crytek's upcoming title Hunt: Showdown is a curious blend of survival horror, shooter, and plain-old survival game set in a gothic-horror version of the wild west. And, as we've written about before, it works. Today, we've got an exclusive first look at the studio's third developer diary, which sheds light on the game's development – in more ways than one.
The video below shows off an under-the-hood view of the game's development, with members of the team showing the tools they're using to create encounters that are different every time players jump in. You can also see a level set during the daytime, which is a departure from the night-in-the-woods sections that we've seen and played so far.

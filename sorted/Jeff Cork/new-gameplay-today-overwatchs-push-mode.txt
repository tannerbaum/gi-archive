  New Gameplay Today – Overwatch's Push Mode






            Blizzard recently revealed that Overwatch 2 is on the way, but the developer took great pains to ensure that the existing player base isn't left behind. While the PvE content will be exclusive to players who pick up the sequel, existing fans will be able to access all of the new PvP maps, heroes, and modes at no additional cost. Today, we're taking a look at one of those modes, a thing called push.

The concept is simple: accompany a giant Omnic who has an undeniable urge to push a box. Lead him to your team's goal or earn the most points, and you win! Leo and Reiner got to play while they were visiting Blizzard for the Overwatch 2 cover story, and you can see how they fared in today's NGT. Leo fans, this is going to be a rough watch.

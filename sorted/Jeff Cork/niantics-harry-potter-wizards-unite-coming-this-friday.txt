  Niantic's Harry Potter: Wizards Unite Coming This Friday






Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, the latest game from Niantic Labs, is coming to mobile devices this Friday. As it did before with Pokémon Go, Niantic's AR game puts a layer of gameplay over real-world locations – only this time, it's all about magic instead of pocket-sized monsters.

IP aside, another key difference between Wizards Unite and its Pokémon predecessor is its inclusion of a narrative. We don't know how deep it runs at this point, but it appears to be more involved than engaging in the treadmill of catching them all.

You'll be able to download Harry Potter: Wizards Unite on iOS and Android devices in North America starting June 21. For more info on the game, take a look at Imran's hands-on preview.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Mortal Kombat 11






            Netherrealm Studios recently revealed the first wave of info about Mortal Kombat 11, and our very own Suriel Vasquez was at the event. He popped into the office today to walk me and Leo through some of what he learned during his hands-on time with the game, including a look at the new customization, fighting systems, and more.

As Suriel points out, 11 isn't just a better looking reskin of what came before. There are some fundamental changes to how players move and fight, which he breaks down in detail. Also, he does a fatality and it is super gross and cool.

Mortal Kombat 11 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 23.

  New Gameplay Today – The Lord Of The Rings: The Living Card Game






            Fantasy Flight is bringing its tabletop card game based on The Lord of the Rings to the digital space, with today's early access release of The Lord of the Rings: The Living Card Game from developer Asmodee Digital. Dan Tack and Matt Miller walk us through the game and explain why the PvE title is worth considering.

There are a few noteworthy things about this game. First, when (if?) you want to buy more cards, you'll know what you're getting ahead of time – randomized packs aren't a thing. It's also a purely PvE experience, too, with a focus on quests instead of battling other players. Finally, the card for Legolas features an imposter with black hair so who even knows what's going on with this dumb planet anymore.

The Lord of the Rings: The Living Card Game is available in Steam Early Access, with a planned release later this year.

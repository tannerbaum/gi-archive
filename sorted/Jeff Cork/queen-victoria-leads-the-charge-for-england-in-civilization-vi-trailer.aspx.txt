  Queen Victoria Leads The Charge For England In Civilization VI Trailer




Queen Victoria is one of England's most notable rulers, having led the nation through more than 60 years. She's the ruler of England in Civilization VI, too, and you can see what she brings to the table in an all-new look at the game.
The Queen has a variety of unique units and structures at her disposal, which reflect the era in which she reigned. Naval superiority was important during the Victorian Age, and as such she can build a Royal Navy dockyard and enlist the help of the notorious Sea Dogs. On land, she can send her Redcoats off to battle, and build museums to better serve her nation's growth and research.

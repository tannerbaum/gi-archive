Disney Infinity


  New Videos Show How Players Can Flex Their Creative Muscles




Disney continues to offer a deluge of sneak peeks at Disney Infinity as the game approaches its August 18 release date. The latest drop includes a pair of toy-box oriented trailers and a batch of new screens that show some of that mode's possibilities.
The Toy Box Game Creation trailer highlights the free-form mode, highlighting just a few of the creations that clever players will be able to build in their virtual toy boxes. Some of the highlights include games that bear more than passing resemblances to classics like Super Mario Bros. and Contra. There are also glimpses of familiar characters like Phineas and Ferb's Agent P, Buzz Lightyear, and Wreck-It Ralph. Disney also owns ESPN, and you can catch the sport network's branding in a few shots.

The other trailer, Toy Box Unexpected Pairings, is all about some of the silly mashups that players can expect in the mode. Unlike in the play-set portions of the game, which hold fast to a license's story and setting, toy box is a bit more anarchic. Watch the clip below and see what happens when some of your favorite Disney characters meet up with new friends (or enemies) from other worlds.

When you're done with the trailers, be sure to check out the screenshot gallery below. The chessboard is a particularly nice creation, but just be sure that you're playing with people you trust. There's nothing worse than having to forfeit a game because a third (or fourth) player crashed into the board with a monster truck.

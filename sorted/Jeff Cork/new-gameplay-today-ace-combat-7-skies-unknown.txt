  New Gameplay Today – Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown






            It's been a dozen years since the last numbered entry in the Ace Combat series, and fans have been eager to take to the skies again. Was it worth the wait? Reiner is a longtime fan of the series, and he shares some of Ace Combat 7's highs and lows – including a look at a PlayStation VR mission.

Take a look at our latest NGT to watch ace-pilot Reiner scrape mountaintops, evade fire under cloud cover, and blast a bunch of opposing planes into clouds of debris. We also take a look at some of the unlockables and loadouts before strapping on the VR goggles. Will his lunch stay down? There's only one way to find out! (Fine. He doesn't barf.)

Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 18, with a PC release coming February 1.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Rainbow Six Siege's Burnt Horizon Update






            The latest update for Rainbow Six Siege, Burnt Horizons, is out now, which adds a little Australian flair to the action. Our own Leo Vader got a chance to play the new map and both operators recently, and came back with some pro-level footage. Ladies and gentlemen, this is gaming.

The new operators include Mozzie, who can hack drones and take control of them; and Gridlock, who can shut down roamers by deploying a self-replicating network of spiky traps. Leo is excited for how both characters can potentially change the meta, which he dives into while narrating his 4K gameplay footage.

As for the new map, it has a giant shark.

Burnt Horizons is available now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

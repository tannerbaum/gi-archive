  New Gameplay Today â€“ Gris






            Nomada Studios' upcoming game is an interactive journey that uses art and sound to create an emotionally resonant atmosphere. In other words, Miller is spot-on when he says that watching him play while Leo and I talk over it is clearly the optimal way to experience Gris. Enjoy!

Miller does his best to avoid spoiling too much of what's ahead, as much of the game's power comes from being surprised by its various twists and turns. I will say that the main character is really, really silly looking, and I can't stand her handless, footless design. It looks like four eyelashes wearing a cloak. If you like that kind of half-assed comedy (?), be sure to watch the video below!

Look for the game on Switch and PC on December 13.

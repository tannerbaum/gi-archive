Capcom has announced that it's re-releasing Resident Evil 4 onto PC, in what the company is calling the ultimate HD version of the game. The game, which will be available at the end of February, will run at 60 FPS for the first time.
Capcom says visual improvements include sharpened text and texture upgrades on environments, characters, and other in-game objects. It's also been optimized for widescreen displays.
Players who preorder the game on Steam will get access to a 60-track soundtrack and a digital artbook. The game will unlock when it's released February 28.
Resident Evil 4 was remade as Resident Evil 4 HD on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and released in 2011. The game was originally released on the GameCube back in 2005.

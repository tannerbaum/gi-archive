  New Gameplay Today – Astro Bot Rescue Mission






            This morning, Ben Hanson came into the office with a smile on his face (and a red ring around his eyeballs). Why? He played through the new PlayStation VR game, Astro Bot Rescue Mission. He joins me and Leo in today's NGT to share his enthusiasm while I fumble around in virtual reality. Neat!

You play as a robot who watches the titular Astro Bot jump around the world, grabbing coins and rescuing his fellow bots. The title really does a lot of the heavy lifting here. Much of the magic comes from experiencing the action in VR, but this should provide a decent sense of what to expect. 

Astro Bot Rescue Mission is available today on PlayStation VR.

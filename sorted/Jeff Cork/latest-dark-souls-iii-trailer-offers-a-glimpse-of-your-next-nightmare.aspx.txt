Dark Souls III is available in Japan tomorrow, and From Software has released a new launch trailer for the game aimed at Japanese audiences. Fortunately, thanks to the nature of the Internet and the fact that the dialogue is in English, the rest of us can watch it to further prepare for the game and its April 12 worldwide release on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
The clip builds atmosphere with callbacks to the importance of fire. It culminates with glimpses of some of the game's impressive boss and enemy encounters. If that's not enough for you, be sure to watch our video, which features our own Dark Souls guru Dan Tack playing through the first few hours of the game.

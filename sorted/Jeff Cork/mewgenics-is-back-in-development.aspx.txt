  Mewgenics Is Back In Development






Remember Mewgenics? It was a game from Team Meat featuring genetic manipulation and battling cats. Back in 2014, Super Meat Boy co-creator Edmund McMillen said, "It's coming out this year, don't worry." It didn't. All is not lost, however. Today, McMillen tweeted that a remake of the game is in progress – and that we can expect to see it in a few years.

Updates: The remake of Mewgenics is in effect and in its very early stages! Don’t expect a release for a few years but I’ll be RTing more of the early dev gifs from @TylerGlaiel as we go

McMillen responded to a question on Twitter asking if Team Meat's Tommy Refenes was working on the project by saying, "Not at all."

For more on the game, take a look at our preview from the game's first life.

Our Take
If nothing else, this game is going to have one hell of a post-mortem talk.

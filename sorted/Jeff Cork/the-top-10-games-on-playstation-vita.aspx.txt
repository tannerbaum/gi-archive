  The Top 10 Games On PlayStation Vita






Handheld consoles are often home to a variety of niche games and genres, and the PlayStation Vita keeps that streak going. The system is a great buy for people who can't get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that's not all it has to offer. We've compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.

Sony doesn't seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it's far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There's a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.

Here are Game Informer's picks for the top 10 games on the PlayStation Vita, as it currently stands.

10. Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack
"[T]he smooth, inviting difficulty curve and constant use of inventive new tricks makes Mutant Blobs Attack stand out in the crowded Vita launch lineup. While some other, more buzzed-about titles have come up short, DrinkBox has delivered on the promise of the Vita for platforming fans old and new." – Bryan Vore

9. Shovel Knight
"Indie throwbacks to video games of the early ‘80s are a dime a dozen, but Yacht Club Games successfully rises to the top. The tried-and-true game design principles and elegant checkpoint system make Shovel Knight worth a try no matter which era of gaming you prefer." – Tim Turi

8. Velocity 2X
"Futurlab’s stellar game is challenging and unusual, and its complex controls are demanding. For that reason, Velocity 2X may not fascinate novice gamers, but experienced players will delight at its varied gameplay, spare design aesthetic, and daring speed." – Matt Miller

7. Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc
"Few games keep the wool over your eyes as effectively as this dark tale. Making a story so gripping is tough in a video game, but it's Danganronpa's best attribute. I was surprised, captivated, and challenged by the culprit in every case. Danganronpa proves why having an interactive experience can make stories more thrilling, even in the context of such a bleak scenario." – Kimberley Wallace

6. Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward
"Virtue’s Last Reward kept me addicted, challenged, and constantly guessing. As the sequel to 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, it lives up to its legacy and invigorates the graphic adventure genre. Don’t let this one pass you by; VLR is one of my favorite games this year." – Kimberley Wallace

5. Persona 4 Golden
"Persona 4 Golden’s greatest strength is that everything fits together seamlessly, from the connected battle and social aspects to the fresh changes. Newcomers are sure to find plenty to love, while series veterans can revisit fond memories and experience new content. This game still remains one of the best RPGs to date; don’t miss out on your second chance to experience it." – Kimberley Wallace

4. Guacamelee
"Even with its platforming frustrations, Guacamelee is an excellent addition to the genre, retaining important classic elements and introducing several fresh additions. The main campaign took me around seven hours (with a decent amount of secret-searching). The pacing is just right, sending you from one adventure to the next without any bloated, boring spots. If you've got a PS3 or Vita, go suplex this into your system now." – Bryan Vore

3. Sound Shapes
"I’m surprised by how personally involved I became in the journey of a tiny little ball with a dot on it. Sounds Shapes is an excellent platformer, but the music that progressively fills each stage as you move forward is really what makes the game something special." – Kyle Hilliard

2. Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD
"Even years later, Final Fantasy X is still an exciting RPG, telling a compelling story with plenty of momentum. While the crazy girls-night-out theatrics of X-2 might still cause you to roll your eyes, the battle system is still fast and fun. For those who want the complete arc of the Final Fantasy X saga, the collection delivers. Even without a nostalgic lens, both games hold up well." – Kimberley Wallace

1. Tearaway
"It’s a journey worth taking, and just when you think you’ve reached the end, you encounter a surreal third act that cemented its place as one of my favorite games of the year. I hope Tearaway can find its place among all the blockbusters and new consoles that will be vying for your attention this year. It certainly deserves it." – Matt Helgeson

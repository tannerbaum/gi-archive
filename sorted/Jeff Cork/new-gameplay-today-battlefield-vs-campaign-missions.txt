  New Gameplay Today – Battlefield V's Campaign Missions






            Battlefield 1 marked a departure for the series, in that it split up the campaign into a series of vignettes rather than a single experience that followed an individual soldier throughout the war. Battlefield V takes the same approach, following a variety of Allied troops across several diverse campaigns. Suriel played through them, and he walks Leo and me through his experiences in today's NGT.

We head to Norway, France, and North Africa during our quick tour, getting a look at stealth-oriented gameplay as well as some more traditional all-out firefights. You'll never think about throwing knives the same way again. Well, at least you won't if you ever even thought about them at all in the first place.

Battlefield V is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 20.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Transference 






            Transcendence is out today! Remember that one? It's that weird-looking horror VR game that Ubisoft revealed at E3 a couple of years ago. You know, the one that Elijah Wood directed? Hanson, Leo, and I checked it out today, and you can see what it's like. Warning: It's spooky!

Hanson didn't play in VR, so you don't need to worry about getting nauseated from wild camera motions. Also, you don't need to worry about us whizzing through puzzles before you get a chance to figure them out for yourself. Trust us: It was on purpose. You're welcome?

Transference is out today on PlayStation 4, PC and Xbox One.

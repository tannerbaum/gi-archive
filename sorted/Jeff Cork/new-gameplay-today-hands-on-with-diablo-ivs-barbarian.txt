  New Gameplay Today – Hands On With Diablo IV's Barbarian






            Well, the cat's out of the bag: Diablo IV is a thing. Right after Blizzard announced the eagerly awaited sequel, BlizzCon attendees were able to line up and play through a 20-minute demo, featuring the game's three classes. We visited Blizzard a few weeks ago, and played through the same demo for several hours. Are you specifically curious about how the Barbarian class plays? Well, you're in luck!

Today, we have a lengthy look at the melee-focused hero. We roll through the demo's main questline and show off just what this beefy character brings into battle. If you're into melee and getting right into enemies' faces, the choice is pretty clear. If that's not your thing, don't worry. We'll be taking similar looks at the sorceress and druid classes this week, too, so be sure to come back for those.

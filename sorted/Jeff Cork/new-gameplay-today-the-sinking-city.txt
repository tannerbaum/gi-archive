  New Gameplay Today â€“ The Sinking City






            Get ready to lose your mind in today's NGT. Reiner recently got some new hands-on time with The Sinking City, a mystery game set in a world inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's demented imagination.

This one's got it all: Investigations! Combat! Exploration! Fish-faced people and folks who look like they staggered out of a Planet of the Apes time capsule. All the while, protagonist Charles Reed has to maintain his dwindling sanity in a city that just so happens to be... sinking. Sorry.

The Sinking City is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on June 27.

            .

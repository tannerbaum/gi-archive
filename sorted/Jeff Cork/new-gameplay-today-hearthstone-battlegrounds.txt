  New Gameplay Today â€“ Hearthstone Battlegrounds






            During last week's BlizzCon, Blizzard revealed that Hearthstone is getting an auto-battler mode, similar to what you might experience in Auto Chess. Weird, right? In today's NGT, Dan Tack shows Leo and me that it makes a lot more sense than you might initially think.

Dan plays through a couple of matches, painstakingly walking us through every one of his strats. Unfortunately, the RNG gods may not have looked favorably upon us. Look. You win some, you lose some. And sometimes you just lose some. Get 'em next time, tiger!

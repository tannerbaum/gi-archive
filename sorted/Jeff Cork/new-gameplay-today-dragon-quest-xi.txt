  New Gameplay Today – Dragon Quest XI






            Dragon Quest XI is the latest entry in the long-running series, and it's also been Kim's sole focus for what seems like a million weeks. Look. The game's long, is all we're saying. She was kind enough to take me and Leo on a quick tour through the game, showing off everything from how the combat plays out to the skill trees to how you can get weather forecasts from cows. Yes.

There's a lot to see in the game – it can easily slurp up 100-plus hours of your time, after all – but this should give you an overall sense of what to expect from this adventure. As Kim points out, it's a nice option for people who pine for an epic, turn-based JRPG. Or for people who want to play a game with characters who kill Handsome Crabs by slamming them with their butts.

Dragon Quest XI is coming to PlayStation 4 and PC on September 4.

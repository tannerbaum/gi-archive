  New Gameplay Today – My Brother Rabbit






            My Brother Rabbit is a surreal hidden-object game about childhood disease. Wait, wait! Don't go! It's also pretty darned good! Reiner shows off the game to me and Leo in our latest NGT, and we realize that we're actually pretty much the best at finding things. 

Take a look at the episode to get a sense of how the object-finding, puzzle, and story elements all work together; it makes more sense than you might think. And it has a surprisingly touching story, which covers some fairly grim subject matter.

My Brother Rabbit is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac.

P.S. If you ever lose a balloon or are looking for a frozen treat, call us up. We can help!

Square Enix has revealed that its town-building game Dragon Quest Builders is getting a day-one edition, which includes three special recipes that players can use in the game's free-build mode. Since it's a Dragon Quest game, of course one of them is slime-related.
In Dragon Quest Builders, players explore the world of Alefgard, building up a town and creating their own designs. If you build well enough, NPCs will come to set up shop in your community, giving you quests and other incentives to further explore the world.
The game's day-one edition includes a voucher, which can be redeemed to unlock slimy blocks, gold blocks, and springtime sprinkles recipes. It's set for a physical release October 11 on PS4 and will also be available for download on Vita.

Civilization VI


  Behold The Builders In New Civilization VI Trailer




Big changes are coming to Civilization VI, and today Firaxis is sharing what's in store for construction. In the latest game, workers have been replaced by builders – and it goes beyond a simple name change.
In previous Civ games, players used worker units for construction. These units would take several turns to work their magic, building new structures and other must-have places for your burgeoning nation. With Civilization VI, workers have been replaced with builders. These new units are trained in cities, and they have a limited number of "building" charges before they disband. 
You can learn more in the trailer below.

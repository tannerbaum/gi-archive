We Happy Few's developer, Compulsion Games, released a few new tidbits about the dystopian game, including a look at a new playable character, Sally. The devs say in a new video that they're taking player feedback seriously, and have retooled the story to incorporate bigger moments earlier on. Those changes mean players will have to be a little more patient, however.
The game was originally set for an April 13 release, but it's now been pushed to sometime this summer. The video below explains the decisions in greater detail. More interestingly, it shows off Sally. From what little we can see, it appears as though she's able to bewitch her enemies. Then again, maybe she just likes to dance?

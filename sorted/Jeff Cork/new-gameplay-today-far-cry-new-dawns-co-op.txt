  New Gameplay Today – Far Cry New Dawn's Co-op






            Everything's better with a friend – or at least that's what they keep telling us. Does that pro-friendship saying translate to the post-apocalyptic wasteland? Maybe? At the very least, Imran played some co-op in Far Cry New Dawn, and Leo and I drill him for info.

There's a lot of new stuff to see here, including a look at the game's version of Florida. That's right! You're no longer stuck in Montana (Montana is great, Montanans! We love it!). You can head out on expedition missions and get supplies to help build out your home base. Look, we get into all of it, so just watch the video. Please?

  New Gameplay Today – A Look At Magic: Legends' Mind Mage






            Magic: Legends' Mind Mage is a ranged class loadout that specializes in crowd control, and also sports an incredible escape ability that lets him drop a doppleganger and take to the shadows while foes go after the copy. At least, that's the basic idea. In today's NGT, Dan Tack, Leo Vader, and Kim Wallace talk about Cryptic's upcoming title, and how some of the deck-building conceits from the card game make the transition to the world of action-RPGs. Join us for a trip through an "ordeal" which is a smaller slice of gameplay compared to bulkier quest missions, with less focus on story and more focus on bashing baddies and objectives.

Most of the crew recently visited Cryptic's offices for the cover story, and they share their hands-on impressions of the overall game, in addition to talking about the Mind Mage.

Magic: Legends is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2020.

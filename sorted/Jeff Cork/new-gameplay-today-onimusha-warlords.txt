  New Gameplay Today – Onimusha: Warlords






            Capcom is releasing its Onimusha: Warlords remaster today, which gives players a chance to check out the samurai action game on modern hardware. Reiner reviewed the game for us when it first came out on PlayStation 2, and he walked Kyle and me through some of the changes players can expect from the remaster.

The biggest tweaks? Textures are displayed at higher resolutions, the game supports widescreen displays, the soundtrack has been updated, and you can use analog sticks. Other than that, it's the same weird game that fans love – the bizarre demons just happen to look a little sharper.

Onimusha: Warlords is out now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

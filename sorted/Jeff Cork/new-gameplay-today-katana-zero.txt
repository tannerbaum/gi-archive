  New Gameplay Today – Katana Zero






            Katana Zero's blade-wielding protagonist isn't necessarily kind, but they're all about rewinding. When every hit is potentially deadly, it pays to be able to turn back the clock and try again. Nothing matters!

Joe Juba's been playing the game, and he lends his skills in today's episode while Leo, Ben Reeves, and I do our best to ask very smart questions. "Why did you die there?" "How come that guy keeps killing you?" "Are you sure that you've been playing the game?" These are just a few of the questions you may or may not hear – and that's an NGT promise! 

Look for it on Switch and PC on April 18.

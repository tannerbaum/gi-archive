  New Gameplay Today â€“ Last Year: The Nightmare






            The Discord-exclusive PC game Last Year: The Nightmare came out today. Can five teens survive a night at school with a crazed killer running amok? What if that killer happens to be our own Leo Vader?

Last Year: The Nightmare hits some of the same notes as games like Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th, but its '90s aesthetic and imaginative slasher designs help it stand out. Reiner and I cheer on Leo as he does his best to hook, axe, and pummel his way through the senior class. (Leo also played a round as a student, and it may or may not have gone as well. Let's pretend it never happened, OK?)

Last Year: The Nightmare is available now on PC via the Discord store.

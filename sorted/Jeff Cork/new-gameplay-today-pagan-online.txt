  New Gameplay Today – Pagan Online






            Just like it is with cake, it seems as though there's always room for another action-RPG. Today we look at Pagan Online, an upcoming title from Mad Head Games and Wargaming.net, currently in early access. There are plenty of unknowns and under-construction signs, but as Dan Tack shows us, there's still a lot to appreciate. 

Multiplayer isn't available quite yet, but Dan didn't let that stop him from taking on a couple of challenges and a story mission. He's also super blase about leaving loot on the ground, which may be a trigger for people who compulsively clean everything up in Diablo-style games. Sorry!

            .

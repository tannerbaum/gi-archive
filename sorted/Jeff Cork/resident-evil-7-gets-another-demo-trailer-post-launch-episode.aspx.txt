Apparently, Capcom couldn't contain Resident Evil 7: Biohazard to its planned format. The publisher has announced that the game's post-launch story episodes are growing by one, increasing the tally to three. If you've already preordered the deluxe edition, you're set, but otherwise you'll have to pony up a little extra cash. Ten bucks, to be exact.
The deluxe edition of the game includes a season pass for the additional content, and it's now priced at $89.99. That gets you the game when it launches January 24, as well as the three other episodes. Both it and standard pre-orders include a survival pack, which includes a lucky coin defense item and healing items; early access to the game's madhouse mode; and, for PlayStation 4 pre-orders, a dynamic PS4 theme.
You can see a new trailer for the game below, but if you're eager to get your hands on some new RE7 action, you're in luck. The game's PS4 demo has been updated to what Capcom is calling a Twilight version of the game, which includes new areas to explore in the mansion. Presumably, none of which are populated with sparkly vampires.

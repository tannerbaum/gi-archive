  New Gameplay Today – Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare's Multiplayer






            Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's name might give you a feeling of deja vu, but Infinity Ward's upcoming entry in the series isn't a retread of CoD 4. In today's episode of NGT, we look at some of the multiplayer modes, including one that's a pretty significant departure from what you've played before.

First, we play the new Azhir Cave map during the day, followed by a quick tour of the gunsmith mode and a look at some of the perks you'll be able to unlock. Afterward, we revisit Azhir – though it's under less hospitable circumstances. In that second match, we fight at night while playing in realism mode. There's no HUD, kill confirmations, or other elements that players have grown accustomed to.It's an unexpectedly frightening twist on Call of Duty, as you can see in the video below.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25.

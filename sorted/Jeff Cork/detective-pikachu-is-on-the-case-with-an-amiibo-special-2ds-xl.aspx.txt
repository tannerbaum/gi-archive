  Detective Pikachu Is On The Case With An Amiibo, Special 2DS XL






Nintendo has released a string of clues about the upcoming Detective Pikachu game, which lets the player work together with a gruff-talking Pokémon to solve mysteries. The game is coming out in late March, and its release is going to be accompanied by a specially themed 2DS XL Pikachu Edition and a new Detective Pikachu Amiibo. 
Take a look at the trailer below to see a Pikachu say more than its own name as he solves mysteries in Ryme City.

Players who tap the figure onto their system can access cutscenes with additional clues more quickly than they would be able to through normal gameplay.
The Pikachu Edition 2DS XL is coming January 26, and it's priced at $159.99. You can see how Pikachu's grinning mug translates to the console's form factor below.

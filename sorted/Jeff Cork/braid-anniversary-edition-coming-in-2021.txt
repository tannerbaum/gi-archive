  Braid: Anniversary Edition Coming In 2021






Braid was a pioneering game in more ways than one, with the 2008 game delivering not only mind (and time) bending puzzles but helping to usher in the rise of indie gaming. If you didn't get a chance to play Number None's game when it first released or are looking for an excuse to revisit it, the newly announced Braid: Anniversary Edition may be right up your alley.

The updated version includes enhanced visuals and animations, such as adding animated brushstrokes to backgrounds to fully sell the overall painterly aesthetic. It also includes a full developer commentary, which digs into some of the design decisions the team made during the game's development.

Braid: Anniversary Edition is coming out in 2021 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Mac.

  New Gameplay Today – Planet Alpha






            Planet Alpha's opening moments don't provide much in the way of gameplay innovation, but they sure are pretty. In this episode of NGT, Reiner pushes some boxes, climbs up some vegetation, and does his best to stay out of enemy vision cones. Like I said, it's not exactly innovative stuff, but it sure is pretty.

There is a time-manipulation element in these opening minutes, which could potentially be used in some interesting ways. We don't see how that develops, but we do get to push a lot of boxes. Also, there are yucky bugs!

Planet Alpha is out today on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

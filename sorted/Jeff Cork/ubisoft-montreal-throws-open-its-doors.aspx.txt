  Ubisoft Montreal Throws Open Its Doors






We saw a lot of Rainbow 6 Patriots while we were visiting Ubisoft's Montreal offices, but that wasn't all we got to check out. During our trip, we also received a nice tour of the studio's downtown digs. Check out our exclusive video tour to see where all the magic happens.
Ubisoft moved into the building nearly 15 years ago, employing about 500 people. Now the former textile factory is home to about 2,100 employees, including the teams behind games as varied as Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Just Dance. Cedric Orvoine, Ubisoft Montreal's director of communications, took us on a guided tour of the facilities, which you can see below. Enjoy!

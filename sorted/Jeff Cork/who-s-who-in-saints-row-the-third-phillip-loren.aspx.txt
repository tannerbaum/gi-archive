  Who’s Who In Saints Row: The Third—Phillipe Loren






The Saints Row series is known for a lot of things, but memorable 
characters aren’t high on that list. Aside from Johnny Gat or Shaundi, 
Stilwater was largely populated by ciphers and forgettable wannabes. Of 
course, while you’re spraying raw sewage on passers by in a septic truck
 or setting them alight in a go kart, you’re probably not too concerned 
about making new friends.
With Saints Row: The Third, Volition is going out of its way to 
deliver loads of action as well as a lineup of interesting friends, 
rivals, and other people. This week, Game Informer is highlighting just 
some of the folks you’ll be interacting with in Steelport.
“Phillipe Loren is the leader of the Syndicate, in particular the 
gang called the Morning Star,” says Steve Jaros, lead writer of Saints 
Row: The Third. “He’s kind of like a Bond villain. He’s statuesque and 
poised and elegant, and he’s a total gentleman. He’s not a fop—he’s not 
effeminate—and he’s not going to play to that European stereotype. He’s 
coldly logical and dangerous and very savvy.”
Phillipe is the main antagonist in the game, essentially kicking off 
the game’s story by kidnapping the player character, Johnny Gat, and 
Shaundi after a botched bank robbery. The game’s first mission takes 
place in Phillipe’s jet, as the player blasts his way out of the 
aircraft and down into Steelport.
It turns out that the player has made a powerful enemy in Phillipe, 
who’s far more powerful than the street level thugs that littered 
Stilwater. “He’s made a killing being an international arms dealer. He’s
 pretty much the leader of the criminal fraternity in Steelport. He 
calls all the shots, he directs everybody, he’s the guy that you just 
don’t want to f--- with.”

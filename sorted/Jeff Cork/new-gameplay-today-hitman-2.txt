  New Gameplay Today – Hitman 2






            We were at Gamescom last week in Cologne, Germany, which means we got our fill of pretzels, Kolsch, and crowds. Oh yeah! We also played a bunch of games, including the upcoming Hitman sequel. In this episode of NGT, I head to Miami and take out two targets – while Leo and Fava provide (technically) insightful commentary.

This was the first time we've been able to play the complete version of the Miami level, and it's a big one. There's a lot going on, including an auto race – the perfect backdrop for Agent 47 to do what Agent 47 does best. That would be choking people out and stealing their clothes. Whatta creep! 

Hitman 2 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 13.

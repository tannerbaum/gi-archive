  Speck Limited Edition Sweepstakes






We're giving away awesome limited edition Tomb Raider-themed iPhone/iPod cases by Speck. These aren't your usual "pretty" phone cases. Speck creates several iPhone and iPod cases specifically for gaming. The CandyShell has a soft rubbery protection on the inside and a glossy hard shell. It also has specialized grippy finger pads on the back and the four bumps on the edge bezel lock in thumb placement on the iPod's touchscreen so you won't lose track of your games' virtual buttons. In addition and specifically for our Game Informer readers, Speck now created a Limited Edition Tomb Raider/Game Informer ToughShell Case for the iPhone 4. 
The ToughShell is even a class above Speck’s CandyShell and designed for those that need that extra bit of protection, like Lara Croft. Three ultra-rugged layers of reinforced protection and insulation with a textured silicon grip band designed to seal the case. All ports and buttons are covered. It also includes a detachable holster with rotating belt clip that doubles as a viewing stand. You like? Well, there's only 20 of them and this is the only place you can get one, so what are you waiting for?

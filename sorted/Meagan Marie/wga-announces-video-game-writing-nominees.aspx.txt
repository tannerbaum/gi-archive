  WGA Announces Video Game Writing Nominees






The Writers Guild of America’s East and West labor unions have united to announce nominations for achievement in video game writing for 2010. An awards ceremony will be held on February 5 simultaneously in Los Angeles and New York to honor the best qualifying video game scripts released from December 1, 2009, to November 30, 2010.
The guild was established to represent writers in a variety of fields including cinema, television, cable, digital media, and broadcast news. The Video Game Writers Caucus’ intent is to “promote storytelling excellence in video games, improve the status of gaming writers, and encourage uniform standards within the gaming industry.”

  Character Profile: Cole, Augustus






The baddest thrashball player on Sera is back. Augustus Cole has always been a fan favorite, and he's got a new look for the final installment. Here comes the Cole Train. We've been coordinating with Epic to get the straight word on what situation we'll find each of the characters in as Gears of War 3 begins. The team was kind enough to provide us with detailed character descriptions that we've integrated into these visual profiles. Today's installment highlight Augustus Cole, the towering soldier that's been a part of Delta since the first game. To get the full view and details about the Cole Train, click on the image below.

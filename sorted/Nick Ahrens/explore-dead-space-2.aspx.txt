  3D Screen: Explore Dead Space 2






While we’ve had a ton of awesome content for our cover story on Dead Space 2, we’re not done quite yet and today we’ve got a cool treat for you in the form of a 3D image. Using Photosynth technology, we’ve worked with EA and Visceral Games to build an explorable scene starring everyone’s favorite engineer turned necromorph slayer. Please note that you’ll need the Silverlight plugin (the same thing Netflix uses) to view the image. Enjoy!

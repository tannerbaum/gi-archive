  Meet The Guys At Irrational






If you think Bioshock was a fun game to play, imagine how cool it would be to work with the guys who made it. The team at Irrational is a bunch of lovable goofballs and we flipped on the camera just to see what we'd get as we wandered the office. Whether it's jokes about Richard Dreyfus or silly stories from the balcony, the Bioshock Infinite team never seems to take themselves too seriously. We're ending this week with a fun, light-hearted look inside the studio and we'll be back next week with even more exclusives.

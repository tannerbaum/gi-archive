  Junction Point: A Studio Profile






Excitement is high for Disney Epic Mickey. No one’s more excited than the team working on the game. (Well, maybe us.) But who are these guys? Who is Junction Point? Warren Spector’s new game studio is full of great talent, and we sat down with a few of the key developers and find out just a little bit about who they are. The video is also bookended with Spector giving some philosophy about running a studio. Sometimes it’s nice to meet the minds behind a game.
All month long, we've been featuring extra content from Epic Mickey including an art montage and a time-lapse. You can find it all at the Epic Mickey hub.

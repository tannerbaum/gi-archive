  GI And Irrational Talk Bioshock Infinite Covers






Now that the cat is out of the bag, we’re excited to continue 
our Bioshock Infinite coverage. If you happened to be at PAX this year, 
you may have caught Andy and Reiner hanging with the Irrational team on 
stage as they talked about making Game Informer covers and unveiled our 
three very special edition covers. If you didn’t, we’ve got you covered 
with this video of GI and Irrational talking about the process that led 
up to making the “She & Him” cover you see above. We’re just getting
 started with our coverage, and you can expect a lot more all this month
 here on gameinformer.com.

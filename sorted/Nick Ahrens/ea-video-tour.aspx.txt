  EA Games Campus Video Tour






While we were visiting Visceral Games on the EA Redwoods Shores campus, we thought it would be a great idea to have them show us around. We convinced Dead Space 2’s Senior Designer John “JC” Calhoun to take us on a tour. The campus was huge and we only saw a small fraction of it. EA definitely knows how to decorate is style and features a huge theater, art exhibits, game lounges, a Starbucks and even a library to check out games (much like GI’s own Vault). Don’t miss this interesting look inside the EA campus. This video contains music by Solid Gold.

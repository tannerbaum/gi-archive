  In His Own Words: Cliff Bleszinski






As the face of Epic Games, design director Cliff Bleszinski is well 
known to the gaming audience. The famed developer has been honing his 
craft for years over titles such as Jazz Jackrabbit, Unreal Tournament, 
and more recently the Gears of War series. We sat Cliff down at his desk
 in the Epic offices and spoke with him about everything from his first 
moments with video games to how he get into development, and even what 
he’d like to explore through his games in the future. This video 
interview is just part of our epic (no pun intended) coverage of Gears 
of War 3, so don’t miss our hub!

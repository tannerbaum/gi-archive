  Developer Commentary: Gears of War 3






We've spent the month relaying lots of info and details
about Epic's big trilogy-ending game, but there's nothing like hearing straight
from the folks behind the game. To that end, executive producer Rod
Fergusson and design director Cliff Bleszinski sat down to give us an audio
tour of the Gears of War 3.  Accompanied by screens and art from the game,
watch the full videos below.
Due to the long length of the videos, some users may have to load the entire video before play starts.

  Sketching Mickey: The Time-Lapse Video






            Any day now, Game Informer subscribers will receive the November issue, which is filled with details about Epic Mickey, the Wii-exclusive game from Junction Point and Disney Interactive Studios. In the meantime, we’ve put together this short film for your enjoyment – a three-minute time-lapse video shortened from a half-hour of drawing by artist Jordan Lamarre-Wan at Junction Point. As you watch Mickey come to life on the page, you’ll also get your first glimpse at a potential enemy in the game – one of the robotic Beetleworx. Keep your ears open as well to hear some of the great music from the upcoming game. For more Epic Mickey content, check out gameinformer.com/epicmickey Enjoy!

  Studio Tour: Epic Games






Ever wonder what itâ€™s really like at Epic Games? We took our cameras inside the legendary game studio for the full tour. From the front hall to the back of the mo-cap studio, Design Director Cliff Bleszinski walks us around the office. We even get a sneak peek into the new wing the company is building to expand their business. As part of our month long Gears of War 3 coverage, enjoy the tour. Because of the length, the tour has been broken up into four segments.

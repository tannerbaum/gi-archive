  Play Street Fighter V For Free This Weekend






Capcom's Street Fighter V is currently free to play on Steam. This offer is only available through the weekend, though, so take advantage of it while you can. 

This is a free trial period, meaning that the game will become unavailable to you once it's over, unless you purchase the title. If you decide you want to keep the game permanently, Street Fighter V will be offered at a discount price following this weekend, at 60 percent off ($7.99) until August 14.

For more on Street Fighter V, take a look at three upcoming DLC characters and their respective trailers by heading here.

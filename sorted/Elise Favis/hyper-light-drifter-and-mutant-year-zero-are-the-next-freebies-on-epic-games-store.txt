  Hyper Light Drifter And Mutant Year Zero Are The Next Freebies On Epic Games Store






Hyper Light Drifter and Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden will soon be free on the Epic Games Store.

The digital marketplace has been rotating free games, sometimes one at a time and other times it's two at once. Currently, the colorful puzzle game GNOG is free to nab.

By August 15, GNOG will be replaced by Hyper Light Drifter and Mutant Year Zero. These two titles will be available until August 22.

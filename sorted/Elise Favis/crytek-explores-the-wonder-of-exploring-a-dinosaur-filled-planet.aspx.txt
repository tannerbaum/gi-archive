Robinson: The Journey


  Crytek Showcases The Wonder Of Exploring A Dinosaur-Filled Planet




Crytek's Robinson: The Journey releases in just two days for PlayStation VR. In anticipation of its release, the development team has revealed a dev diary that focuses specifically on the companions and dinosaurs you'll encounter in the game.
Robinson: The Journey is an exploration-driven VR game that blends puzzle solving with storytelling. You play as a young boy marooned on a faraway planet that is filled with dinosaurs, both hostile and friendly. You'll have two companions, one being the the floating AI orb HIGS that you follow to maneuver around the world, as well as a T-Rex named Laika.

Robinson: The Journey is out on November 8. You can watch a previous dev diary by heading here.

  Rainbow Six Siege Is Getting A Battle Pass






Ubisoft announced today that Rainbow Six Siege will soon have a battle pass system. It will introduce a new progression track for players that unlocks cosmetics, renown boosters, and new operator lore.

It will roll out in two phases, starting with the free 7-day pass "Call Me Harry" for Ember Rise. Later this year, a full-fledged battle pass will premiere with Rainbow Six Siege's season four.

This battle pass won't require you to compete specific challenges. Instead your progression will be judged on how often you play. You'll collect "battle points" every match which will eventually get you to the next level of the battle pass.

For more on Rainbow Six Siege, take a look at our video where Leo tries out new operators, including one with a grappling hook. You can watch additional gameplay of Ember Rise with our New Gameplay Today.

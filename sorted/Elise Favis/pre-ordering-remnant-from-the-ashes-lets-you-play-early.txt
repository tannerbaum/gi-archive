  Pre-Ordering Remnant: From The Ashes Lets You Play Early






Gunfire Games’ Remnant: From The Ashes is out in two days, but you don't have to wait to play it. By pre-ordering today on PC or Xbox One, you can jump in right now, thanks to a VIP preview weekend event.

This co-op shooter (but you can also play solo) takes cues from the Souls series and Left 4 Dead. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world with procedurally generated areas, bringing unpredictability to the gameplay.

Pre-ordering the game will also grant you three exclusive armor sets and an item pack to help you survive.

Remnant: From the Ashes is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 20. You can watch us play through a portion of it on New Gameplay Today alongside Gunfire co-founder and Remnant design director John Pearl.

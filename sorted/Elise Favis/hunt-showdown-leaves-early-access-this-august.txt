  Hunt: Showdown Leaves Early Access This August






Crytek's horror multiplayer shooter Hunt: Showdown is exiting Early Access soon for a full release.

It was in Steam Early Access since last year, and in Xbox Game Preview earlier this year. Now, it's launching in full on both PC and Xbox One as of August 27. PlayStation 4 owners can get their hands on the game at an undisclosed time in the fall.

Hunt: Showdown casts players as bounty hunters who must slay a beast that haunts rural Louisiana, then bring back its head. You can watch us play a portion of it here as well as read our impressions from the early access PC build here.

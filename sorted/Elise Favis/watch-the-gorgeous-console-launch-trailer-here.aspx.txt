Heart Machine's Hyper Light Drifter is now making its way over to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in just a couple days time. 
The Zelda-like adventure offers tough combat and an enthralling world, and it took our breath away when it released in April. Now, console gamers will be able to enjoy its fantastical world and beautiful soundtrack as well.

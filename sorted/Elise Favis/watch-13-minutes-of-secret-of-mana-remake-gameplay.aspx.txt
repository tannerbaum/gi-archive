A new PlayStation Underground video shows off some gameplay of the upcoming remake of Secret of Mana. With a fresh coat of paint and a fully-voiced cast, this remake reimagines the 1993 classic for modern audiences.
In the video, we get to see a playthrough of a dungeon, along with a boss fight at the end. We also get a glimpse of the local multiplayer, a new feature that allows you to complete quests with up to two other friends. We also see characters wearing DLC costumes, such as a Moogle costume.
Watch the thirteen minute video below.

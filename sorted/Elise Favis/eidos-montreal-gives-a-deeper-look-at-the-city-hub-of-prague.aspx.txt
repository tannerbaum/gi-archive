Deus Ex: Mankind Divided


  Eidos Montreal Gives A Deeper Look At The City Hub Of Prague




Eidos Montreal gives an overview of Adam Jensen's apartment, Prague, and the new augmentations at his disposal in this gameplay video. 
In the video, Jensen wakes up in his apartment following a terrorist attack the previous day. He's recovering, but his cybernetic enhancements took a hit, so he decides to visit Vaclav Koller, a friend and underground augmentations specialist. Before leaving, game director Jean-Francois Dugas shows us around Jensen's apartment. He informs us that Jensen's apartment is filled with little details, such as emails, news, and you can even call your old boss David Sarif through the TV.

Outside, the city is entirely explorable, with its own secrets and side-quests depending on who you talk to and where you go. On the way to meet Koller, Jensen uses mostly a stealth approach mixed with lethal and non-lethal attacks. You can mismatch his augmentation powers, such as using his sound suppressing ability to walk silently with his cloaking skill to remain invisible. Several new augmentations means Jensen has a lot of options on how to tackle missions. For example, the Tesla augmentation allows him to target up to 4 enemies once it's fully upgraded, and disable them non-lethally. The nano blade gun-arm can shoot out a blade like a bullet to kill foes.

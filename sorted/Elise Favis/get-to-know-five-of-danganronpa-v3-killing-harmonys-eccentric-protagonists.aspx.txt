Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony


  Trailer Shows Off New Characters




In a recent trailer revealed by NIS America, we are introduced to five quirky protagonists coming to the upcoming visual novel Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony. 
The Danganronpa series has always been known for eccentric high school students who face death in unusual ways, thanks to a sadistic bear who watches their every move. Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony brings back these themes, but takes place in a different school and introduces new mini-games. 
In the trailer below, we meet five ultra-talented high schoolers who will soon scheme each others deaths and face off in trials. These characters include Ryoma (Ultimate Tennis Pro), Kaito (Ultimate Astronaut), Himiko (Ultimate Magician), Angie (Ultimate Artist) and Monodam (a robotic cub to the original Monokuma).

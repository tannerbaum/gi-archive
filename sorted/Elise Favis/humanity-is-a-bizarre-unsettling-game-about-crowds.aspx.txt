Tha LTD

Release

Masses of people, similar to crowds you find in metropolitan subway stations, walk forever forward. They traverse through pristine, tile floored areas, where giant falling cubes may block their way. Sometimes other humans kill them. This is the premise of a trailer showing off Humanity, an upcoming game billed as a "crowd action game" by Japanese developer tha ltd.
It's unclear exactly what the objective of the game is, but from the trailer, it looks like you attempt to guide massive crowds through different places. With an unsettling narrator talking about what it means to be human and the overall aesthetics, Humanity looks to be an unsettling but intriguing game.
Take a look for yourself at the trailer below.

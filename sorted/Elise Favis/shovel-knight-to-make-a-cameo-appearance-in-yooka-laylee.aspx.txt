  Shovel Knight To Make A Cameo Appearance In Yooka-Laylee




A new trailer for the upcoming 3D platformer Yooka-Laylee teased that Shovel Knight will be making an appearance in the highly anticipated game, where he will be a non-playable character.
Shovel Knight has made cameo appearances in several other games, including Runbow, Road Redemption, and more. According to EuroGamer, Playtonic developers and Yacht Club Games hopped on Skype to practice Shovel Knight's silly-sounding dialogue, which is pretty amusing. 
Outside of Shovel Knight, the trailer below also presents many of Yooka-Laylee's quirky characters, such as the corporate mogul Capital B and Trowzer the snake (yes, you read that right).

Yooka-Laylee is being created by Rare veterans, and is a love letter to the likes of Banjo-Kazooie. It will release next year in March. You can read our hands-on impressions from Gamescom here.

  Character Trailer Focuses On The Stoic Assassin Hit




Dragon Ball FighterZ comes out later this month, and Bandai Namco is continuing to drop trailers as we inch closer to its release. The newest teaser centers around Hit, a stoic assassin.
In the trailer, we see him fight against Goku. Hit is a character from Dragon Ball Super, similar to Goku Black. As an incredibly quick and deadly fighter, he puts up quite the fight. Check out the teaser below.

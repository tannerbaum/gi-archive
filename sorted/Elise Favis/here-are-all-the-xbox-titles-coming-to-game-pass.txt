  Here Are All The Xbox Titles Coming To Game Pass






During today's Gamescom livestream for Xbox, several titles were announced to join Game Pass. Among these are Dead Cells, Ape Out, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and more.

Check out the full list below.

Some quality-of-life changes will make their way to the service, such as being able to search for Facebook and Steam friends and add them on Xbox. Xbox Game Pass for PC's library is also making its way to the mobile app, and it's currently in beta on both Android and iOS.

Microsoft also has a special deal right now if you want to join Xbox Game Pass. You can get 2 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which combines Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold, for just $2 (normally it's $14.99/month). This offer lasts until September 19.

The livestream is still ongoing, and we will add more games to this list if they are announced for Game Pass. Watch the stream here.

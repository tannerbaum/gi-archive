Still There


  Psychological Adventure Game About A Space Lighthouse Keeper




            Still There is an upcoming adventure game that puts you in the shoes of a space lightkeeper who attempts to stay sane all while confronting grief and isolation.

Developer GhostShark hopes to evoke both dark humor and difficult but personal themes. This sounds like it could be a challenging balance, but one that could be incredibly satisfying if done right.

Aboard the Bento Space Lighthouse, you're accompanied by your A.I. companion Gorky and you must solve "technical puzzles" by operating different dials and panels on tech equipment on the station.

The trailer, at the top of this story, plays a message from what I presume is a loved one back on Earth, and it looks like separation from your family will be the main source of your grief.

In a new making of video, Crytek finally pulls back the curtain and shows off its upcoming PlayStation VR title, Robinson: The Journey. The exploration-driven game, which plops you on an alien planet filled with dinosaurs, was first shown at Paris Games Week last year.

Robinson: The Journey tells the story of a boy who was part of an exploration team. While being sent to colonize a planet, something goes wrong with his ship, and it crash lands on this dangerous planet where dinosaurs roam freely. You'll follow a hovering robot who guides you through this hostile land.

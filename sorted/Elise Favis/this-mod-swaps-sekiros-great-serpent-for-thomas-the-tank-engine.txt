  This Mod Swaps Sekiro's Great Serpent For Thomas The Tank Engine






What would it be like if one of the bosses in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was... Thomas the Tank Engine? Well, it turns out the result is something altogether terrifying and hilarious.

Swapping enemies out for Thomas the Tank Engine has become a running joke in the mod community. For example, one of the more recent examples is Thomas taking the place of Mr. X in Resident Evil 2.

Now, you can defeat Thomas (or just watch in horror with the video below) when he takes the place of the Great Serpent in Sekiro.

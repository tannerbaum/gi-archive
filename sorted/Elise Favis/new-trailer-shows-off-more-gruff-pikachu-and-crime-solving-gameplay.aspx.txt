Detective Pikachu is a 3DS game that released in 2016 in Japan, and now it's finally coming to the West. This Pokémon spin-off takes place in Ryme City, centering around Tim Goodman and Detective Pikachu, who team up to solve a number of mysteries.
Crime solving, however, isn't nearly the strangest thing in this Pokémon game. Detective Pikachu sounds like a gruff older man, which so far comes across more unsettling than anything else. Watch the trailer below.

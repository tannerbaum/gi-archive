  Metro Exodus DLC Two Colonels Arrives Tomorrow 






4A Games has two story DLC planned for Metro Exodus, and today we got our first look at one of them during Gamescom's Xbox livestream.

The DLC is titled Two Colonels, and you play as new character Colonel Khlebnikov who is returning to his son for New Year's Eve. Unfortunately, his son's home is invaded by mutants, slimes, and other hazards. A year later, Colonel Miller follows Khlebnikov's footsteps and makes his way through the same tunnels. We see Miller armed with a flamethrower throughout this dangerous journey.

As for the second expansion, it releases in early 2020. That DLC will be set in Vladivostok and have you play as US Marine Sam who is trying to get back to the United States.

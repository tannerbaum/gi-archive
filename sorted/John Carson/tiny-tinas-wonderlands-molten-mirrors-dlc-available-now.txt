Sorry, this video is not available

Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there's plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players' abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. 

However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn't free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.

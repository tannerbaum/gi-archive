  Hades Escapes Onto Xbox Game Pass This Summer






            Almost a year after its initial release, Hades was included in this year’s Xbox E3 show with the announcement it is coming to Xbox consoles on August 13. The standout action rogue-lite from last year was also announced to be coming to Game Pass upon release.

Hades follows Zagreus, the son of the titular ruler who is trying to get out of his hellish home. He fights Greek-inspired gods and monsters wielding a variety of weapons along the way. If he fails, Zagreus finds himself back at home where he can build bonds with the characters he meets on his journey out of the underworld.

There wasn’t anything new content-wise in the trailer, which displayed a variety of awards it received since release. Hades was a game we also liked a lot! Check out why it ended up all the way at number two on Game Informer’s Game of the Year list for 2020, and here is our own Matt Miller’s review to get a critical breakdown of the game.

Alongside its arrival on Xbox consoles and Game Pass, Hades will be making its way to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on August 13. Private Division will be releasing physical copies for all of these new releases which can be preordered on the Private Division store. PlayStation 4 owners of either the digital or physical editions of Hades can upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free, while the Xbox versions benefit from Microsoft's Smart Delivery.

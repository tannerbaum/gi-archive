  Games Pass Additions Amass An Army Of Ninjas And Assassins In June






            Xbox has begun to announce its upcoming slate of Game Pass titles for next month, with six games joining the service in the opening days of June. Sharpen your blades and get ready for plenty of action with the three big games coming to the subscription service over the next week. Ubisoft is providing two games with For Honor: Marching Fire Edition hitting tomorrow and Assassin's Creed Origins arriving on June 7, just in time for Series X owners to enjoy the new 60FPS update. Koei Tecmo is also bringing Ryu Hyabusa's remastered trilogy of 3D adventures to Game Pass with the June 2 addition of Ninja Gaiden Master Collection. 

Here's the full list of Game Pass additions coming in the first part of June:

  Nintendo Direct Focused On 3DS Games Coming September 1






While the Wii U might have one foot in the grave, the 3DS is still getting attention from developers and gamers. You'll be able to find out what's coming next for Nintendo's handheld in just a few days via Nintendo Direct.
Before you get too excited, Nintendo won't be discussing the NX at all. The wait for that continues, even though the console is supposed to be out in a mere seven months.
You can tune into the Nintendo Direct at 10 a.m. Eastern / 7 a.m. Pacific on Thursday, September 1.

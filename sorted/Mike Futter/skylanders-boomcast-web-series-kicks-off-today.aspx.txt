Skylanders Swap Force


  Skylanders Boomcast Web Series Kicks Off Today




With only a little over a week to go before the launch of Skylanders: Swap Force, Activision is ramping up coverage. Today marks the first of a series of weekly webisodes called the Skylanders Boomcast.
The series is hosted by Zachary Gordon (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and features news, gameplay tips, in-depth information on characters, and interviews with members of the team. This week's character spotlight features Fryno (and his "angry bike"). This precedes a major event happening next week right before the launch of Skylanders: Swap Force.
On October 10, Gordon and actor James Marsden will be in Times Square giving fans a chance to play Swap Force before its October 13 release. Prizes will be available, and one fan will get the first starter pack from Marsden.
You can watch the first Boomcast episode below. Skylanders: Swap Force will be out on October 13 for Wii U, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and 3DS. Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions will be available alongside the launch of those consoles.

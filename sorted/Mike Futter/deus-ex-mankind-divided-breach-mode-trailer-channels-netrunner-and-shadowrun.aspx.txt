Deus Ex: Mankind Divided


  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Breach Mode Channels Netrunner And Shadowrun




In addition to Adam Jensen’s story, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided will feature an additional mode called Breach. We touched on it in our earlier preview, but you can get an in-depth look in a lengthy trailer that sets the stage.
In Breach mode, you play as a Netrunner-style hacker working to steal data from a well-guarded server farm. Your virtual avatar will encounter guards and other defenses, which function like the enemies Jensen will encounter.
Your goal is to reach the data towers and get out without being destroyed. Along the way, you’ll unlock cards that serve as environmental mods and weapon modifiers. If you played Rise of the Tomb Raider, the presentation will seem familiar. You’ll also be able to invest in your digital augments similar to how you’ll upgrade Jensen in the core game.

Superhot


  Timebending Shooter Superhot Will Warm Up Your Winter In February




At a time when shooters are competing for the most realistic, grim dark visuals, it’s refreshing to see a developer go in the opposite direction. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign that closed in June 2014, Superhot is almost upon us.
The game’s conceit is that time only moves when you do. That means you’ll have the opportunity (and need) to think about where bullets are traveling so you can avoid them.

I had the opportunity to play Superhot with Oculus Rift at E3 2014 and it was one of the most exciting experiences I’ve had in VR. Using Matrix-like moves to bend around bullets or watch them as they whizzed by was exhilarating. 
While an official VR release hasn’t been confirmed, we can look forward to the game on PC, Mac, and Linux on February 25. An Xbox One release is coming a bit later.

January will be filled with the shambling undead. Capcom has confirmed the release date for Resident Evil 0, along with plans for how the title will get into your hands.
For those of you coming to the series fresh on current-generation consoles, Capcom is bundling the new release with this year’s Resident Evil HD Remake. The pair will cost $39.99 on disc for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on January 19, 2016.
If you already have a copy of HD Remake, you can pick up Resident Evil 0 digitally for $19.99, though Capcom’s language around timing isn’t definite. Capcom says the digital option for Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PC will be along in “early 2016.”

Capcom also shared that series villain Albert Wesker will be playable in his own mode (above). He’ll be teaming up with Rebecca Chambers and replacing Billy Coen if you opt to play that way. Wesker comes with his own abilities that make him more than a re-skin.
I had the chance to play Resident Evil 0 at PAX this weekend. The cutscenes look extremely rough with hideous artifacts and pixelation. Capcom might also do well to give players a way to cut the door and stair animations. While iconic of the series, they bog down progress. Thankfully, Resident Evil 0 has it where it counts, and the gameplay is tight with in-engine visuals living up to expectations.
We’ve reached out to Capcom regarding the digital release timing. We’ll update should we receive a response.

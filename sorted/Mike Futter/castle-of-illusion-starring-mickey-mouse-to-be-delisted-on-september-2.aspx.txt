  [Update] Castle Of Illusion Now Backwards Compatible On Xbox One, To Be Delisted On September 2






Update: Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse is being delisted this week, but as long as you act quickly, you will be able to play it on Xbox One.
It's odd the game is being made backwards compatible right as it leaves the Xbox Live Arcade, but the timing works out okay – as long as you start your download right away.

Disney fans are no stranger to films going "back into the vault." It looks like gamers are going to need to get used to that, also.
Sega has confirmed to us that Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse will be removed from sale at the end of this week. The publisher says that those that have purchased the game will be able to redownload it without issue.
Castle of Illusion was re-released in 2013 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC, Mac, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. The original was released in 1990 on the Sega Genesis. Both feature Mickey on a quest through the titular Castle to save Minnie Mouse from the witch Mizrabel.

Our TakeDespite understanding how licensing works and why games are delisted, it's hard not to look at each one as a little tragedy. For the purposes of preservation, games that were only released digitally become precious artifacts as there's often no good way to capture them legally. If you have the slightest interest in this game, spend the money now lest you face regret later.

Corpse Party


  Horror Adventure Corpse Party Bound For 3DS And PC




The quirky horror Corpse Party series is a cross between visual novel and adventure game. Despite the sprite-based visuals, Corpse Party tells a wonderfully creepy story.
If you don’t have a PSP or Vita, the series probably coasted under your radar. You can remedy that on April 25 on PC or this summer on 3DS.

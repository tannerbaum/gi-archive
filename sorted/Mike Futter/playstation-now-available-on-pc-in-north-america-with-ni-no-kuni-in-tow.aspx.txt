  PlayStation Now Available On PC In North America With Ni No Kuni In Tow






Sony recently announced that PlayStation Now, the company's streaming service, isÂ heading to PC. Following a rollout in Europe, those of us in North America can take it for a spin.
The news comes along with the reveal of six greatest hits titles from the PS3 era joining the service. They are Mafia II, Tomb Raider Game of the Year Edition, Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution, Heavy Rain (with Taxidermist DLC), and Borderlands: Ultimate Edition.
In October, Sony and Konami will be adding Castlevania Harmony of Despair to the service. Other Halloween-themed games will be coming that month.
Sony is also bringing back the one-year PlayStation Now membership. For a limited time, you can get 12 months for $100 ($8.33/month). This is the least expensive monthly rate, with thirty days priced at $20 and three months running $45 ($15 per month).
For those opting into PS Now on PC, a Dual Shock 4 wireless USB adapter is available for $25.

Our TakePlayStation Now still hasn't won me over. The PC option helps, but adding PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games would go a long way to earning my subscription. Sony's approach to older console titles seems scattershot with PS1 classics on PS3 and Vita, PS2 on PS4 games, and then streaming PS3 games. At times, it doesn't seem like Sony even knows where it wants to invest.

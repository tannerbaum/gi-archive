Skylanders Swap Force


  New Video Shows Off Skylanders: Swap Force's New Features




In a little under a month, Activision's $1.5 billion Skylanders franchise will get its third entry. Today, Activision, Vicarious Visions, and n-Space (developer of the 3DS version) are showing off the new features.
The story takes place in a new area of Skylands, the Cloudbreak Islands. Series villain Kaos is back, trying to steal the power from a volcano that replenishes Skylands with magic.
The trailer also gives us a first look at the 3DS version of the game, which is a completely different tale. With Vicarious Visions heading up the console release this year, n-Space is stepping in with the 3DS version. 
You can get a look at some of the new Skylanders figures, the environments, and the minigames that have been added to each level. Skylanders: Swap Force will be available on October 13, 2013, for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and Wii. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions will be available at the launch of those consoles.

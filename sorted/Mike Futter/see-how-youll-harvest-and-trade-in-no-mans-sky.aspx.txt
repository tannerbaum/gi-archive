We’ve previously seen glimpses of exploration and combat in No Man’s Sky. The third installment in the four-part series gives us a quick look at interstellar commerce.

In the video below, you’ll get a short preview of how you’ll gather resources on the ground and in your ship. Once you have cargo, you’ll need to take it to a trading post, where you can also beef up your gear.

Sorry, this video is not available

No Man’s Sky will be out of PlayStation 4 and PC on August 9. For more, check out our most recent preview.

  Fan-Requested Character Angela Comes To Marvel Heroes Today






Angela, Asgard’s Assassin, joins Marvel Heroes today in spectacular fashion. The wingless angel is not a hero to be trifled with, as you’ll see in her reveal trailer.
In September 2015, we teamed up with Gazillion to ask fans which of six new heroes they wanted to see added. You picked Angela, and now you can see how she turned out.

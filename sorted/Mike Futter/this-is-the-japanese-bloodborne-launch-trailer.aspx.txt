This might be the Japanese version of the Bloodborne launch trailer, but you’re in luck. The voiceovers are in English and you can understand just how much trouble you’re in when the title launches.
From Software is moving its challenging gameplay from the dark fantasy setting of the Souls series to Victorian streets. Based on what we’re seeing in the video below, despite the change in setting, you’re still going to die quite a lot.

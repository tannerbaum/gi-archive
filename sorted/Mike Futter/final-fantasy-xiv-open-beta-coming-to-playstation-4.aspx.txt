Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has been a success for Square Enix, redeeming the miserable first launch of the series’ second MMO. A new crop of adventurers will enter Eorzea with a beta beginning on February 22.
The beta will be open to all PlayStation 4 owners, and will occur in two phases. Phase one will run from February 22 through March 3. The second will last from April 4 through April 7. There will be a character reset after phase one. Phase two characters can be carried over to the final release.

The PlayStation 4 versions will release on April 14, with account transfers for existing PlayStation 3 players opening on April 11 at no charge. Doing so will disable your PlayStation 3 version of the game, but prevent the need from repurchasing the upgraded version. If you'd like to continue playing on both consoles, two copies are required.
The PS4 version includes mouse and keyboard support, use of the Dual Shock 4 touchpad, and Vita remote play. It will also be running at 1080p, and some of the new visuals are represented in the trailer above. The video below is a developer diary with director and producer Naoki Yoshida in which he discusses bringing the game to PlayStation 4.

Frozen Synapse 2


  Frozen Synapse 2 Introduces A Procedural World Of Mind-Bending Strategy




Mode 7’s Frozen Synapse differentiated itself from other strategy games by forcing players to anticipate enemy decisions. Instead of a turn-based structure, both players plan and execute moves simultaneously, making Frozen Synapse a unique experiment in psychology.
The follow-up, Frozen Synapse 2, is ambitious in its own right. The single-player campaign features a procedurally generated city, multiple factions with which you can ally and have their own approach, and an opportunity to engage enemies in any location (including buildings) on the map.

Since everything is placed on the map, including all resources and cash, players can choose to ambush other factions. The player’s avatar is also on the map, in a secure base. If that’s invaded and the player killed, it’s game over.
Frozen Synapse 2 adds a strategic layer (think XCOM’s ant farm) on top of the tactical missions. It’s coming to PC later this year. Other platforms are being considered, but have not yet been announced.

  Nuka-World Update Peps Up Fallout Shelter Today






Bottle and Cappy, the adorable, fragile mascots of Fallout 4’s Nuka-World are coming to Fallout Shelter today. The duo bring with them presents for all good Vault Overseers.
The Nuka-World update includes a number of new quests. The 1.7 update also includes weekly quests, as well as special missions for events and holidays. If you complete the Nuka-World quest, Bottle and Cappy will visit your vault with gifts of caps and Nuka-Cola Quantum.

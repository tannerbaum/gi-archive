  Homefront: The Revolution Dated For 2016, Timesplitters Veteran Leading New Studio






Following Crytek's financial woes and the deterioration of its relationship with Deep Silver last year, the Dead Island-publisher acquired the rights to the Homefront franchise. What followed was the formation of a new studio, Dambuster Studios and, as we suspected, the delay of the Homefront: The Revolution.
The studio is now staffed by over 120 individuals, many of whom came over from Crytek UK (which was formerly Timesplitters developer Free Radical Design). The studio and Homefront: The Revolution are led by Hasit Zala, whose LinkedIn profile includes a number of credits dating back to Timesplitters, on which he was a senior programmer.
Zala was the team lead and lead programmer on Timesplitters 2 and Timesplitters: Future Perfect. He was also the director for Homefront: The Revolution when Crytek was developing.

Our TakeGiven the upheaval related to Crytekâ€™s financial issues and Deep Silver taking over, a delay in development makes sense. While Dambuster might be a new studio, the staff includes a number of veterans, not least of which is the studio head Hasit Zala. Homefront looks to be in better shape than it was at the start.

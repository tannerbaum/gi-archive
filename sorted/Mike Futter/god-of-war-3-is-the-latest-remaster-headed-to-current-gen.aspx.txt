  God Of War 3 Is The Latest Remaster Headed To Current-Gen






With Uncharted 4 delayed, one question has echoed in the mind of PlayStation 4 owners: “What else is on tap for this year?” After hearing your cries for more information about this year’s lineup, the publisher has decided to share some news.
God of War 3 is being remastered with release planned for July 14, 2015. Sony says the game will run at 1080p and target 60 frames-per-second. It will also include a photo mode.

The “placeholder” date for a trio of Dead Rising re-releases has now been confirmed by Capcom. The zombie-slaying romps will be available in September.
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners will get access to Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2, and Dead Rising 2: Off The Record. The latter two have already been released on PC, though the first game in the franchise will make its debut alongside the console launches.

You can look for all of these on September 13. And if that’s not enough for you, Dead Rising 4 will be out on Xbox One and PC on December 6.
Each game is priced at $20. On console, the three games are also available in a bundle for $50. On PC, you can right now purchase a Collector’s Pack for $90 that includes Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, Dead Rising 3 and all its DLC, as well as additional DLC for Dead Rising 2 and Off the Record. Physical releases of Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 are coming for console on September 13 and 27 respectively.

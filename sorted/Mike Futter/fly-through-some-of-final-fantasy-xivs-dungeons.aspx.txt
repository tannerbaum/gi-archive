Square Enix wants to show off the majesty of its retuned MMO, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. In a new video, you can see a number of the dungeons and the baddies that inhabit them.
As you might recall, Final Fantasy XIV had some problems when it first launched. Square Enix pulled the game offline and retooled it, relaunching as A Realm Reborn (and we saw it at E3).
Here's some of what you can expect when the MMO re-emerges on August 27, 2013 on PlayStation 3 and PC.

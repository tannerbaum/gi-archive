Gravity Rush 2, the sequel to 2012’s Vita original, brings Kat to a new setting with new people to meet. Today, we get a quick look at some of the characters she’ll encounter later this year.
The game moves from the town of Hekesville to a the floating mining settlement of Banga. Residents there mine gravity ore, a precious resource in Gravity Rush’s world.
Without Dusty, Kat’s feline friend who enables her to manipulate gravity, she’s at a bit of a disadvantage. Along with her friend, Syd, she’ll need to take odd jobs along the way to get by.
You can see some of the cast members including Banga’s mayor Lisa, antagonist Vogo, and more in the gallery below. You’ll also see that the comic book storytelling returns.
Gravity Rush 2 will be out on PlayStation 4 on December 2. For more Gravity Rush, check out our Test Chamber featuring the remastered version that was released earlier this year.

  Evolve Gets Its First Co-Op Story Mission In The Deepest Dark






Over the past two months, 2K and Turtle Rock have given Evolve a new lease on life. With the game going completely free and wooing millions to try the game for the first time or give it another go.
Starting today, players can try something completely new that wasn’t present in the game’s original release in 2015. The Deepest Dark is the first four-player cooperative story mission.

Turtle Rock calls it an experiment, and the studio is looking for feedback from players. Once you access The Deepest Dark via the co-op vs. AI menu, you’ll be dropped into a story mission.
The Queen of Gorgons has infiltrated and occupied a wraith containment facility. Your team needs to make its way to the lair, through aggressive, infected wildlife and gorgon spawn.
You can try this first co-op operation free today as part of Evolve Stage 2. The game is still in beta on PC and completely free with no microtransactions. You can read more about how Turtle Rock and 2K decided to change up the game and give it another shot in our previous coverage.

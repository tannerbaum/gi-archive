  Gran Turismo Sport Delayed Into 2017






The next installment of the vaunted Gran Turismo series isn't going to be speeding onto PS4 this year. Like its predecessors, this one needs to make a pit stop before release.
Originally planned for release on November 15, Gran Turismo Sport won't be out now until 2017. Sony isn't offering up a new release date, or even a narrow window at this time.
"As we approach our planned release date in November, we realize we need more time to perfect GT Sport, which weâ€™ve already dedicated so much effort towards since announcing the title," wrote Polyphony founder Kazunori Yamauchi on the PlayStation Blog. "We do not want to compromise the experience in any way. While we cannot confirm a new release date at this time, we are more committed than ever to making GT Sport the best Gran Turismo game to date."
Next week, Sony is holding a meeting in New York City to discuss PlayStation's future. Provided the company doesn't announce it earlier as more leaks emerge, we expect to officially see a hardware refresh. We also anticipate news on the more powerful console, codenamed Neo.

Our TakeA Gran Turismo without a delay would be a surprise. Polyphony tends to take its time making its racing sims, and the results usually bear out the wait. The wildcard here is whether or not the delay has to do with taking advantage of Neo and making GT Sport a marquee title for the new system.

Disney Infinity


  Here Are The Blind-Buy Power Discs Available At Launch




In three years' time, the concept of toy-based digital titles has gone from a curiosity to one of the biggest draws for video game households with children. A new challenger is about to enter the market, and Disney has a new video to explain how the Infinity Power Discs will work.
Disney Infinity products come in a multitude of types. There's the starter pack that comes with three characters, three playsets and the Infinity base peripheral. Expansions come in the form of additional single characters and value bundles. Playsets come with two characters and a host of new adventure and Toy Box building options. Finally, there are the Power Discs.
Unlike everything else in the Infinity family, Power Discs are acquired in random, blind-buy packs of two each ($4.99). There are 20 in the first wave (pictured below). These fall into three categories: gadgets (equipment), vehicles, and power-ups.

For your reference, abilities are marked with a star (two of which can be stacked below each character on the Infinity base). Gadgets are marked with the ball, and customization elements (textures and skies) are denoted by a paintbrush.
Three of these (Dumbo, Buzz's Astro Blaster vehicle, and Elephant Abu) are "chase" figures and will be present in more rare quantities. In other words, the singles market for these is probably going to get pricey. 
There are two more waves coming, with minor teases on the Disney Infinity website. Wave two will include a Halloween Town customization disc and will include twenty items (with three chase discs). Wave three is only fifteen discs, with a single chase. It will include Alice's croquet flamingo gadget.
Disney Infinity will be out on Sunday August 18, 2013 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. See below for a full list of Series 1 Power Discs.

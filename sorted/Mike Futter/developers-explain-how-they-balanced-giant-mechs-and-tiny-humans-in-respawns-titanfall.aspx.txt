One of our favorite things about the dawn of a new hardware generation is the flood of new intellectual properties. Sure, we'll get sequels to the biggest franchises, but the brand new experiences in fresh, untouched worlds are a source of great excitement.
One of those titles is our E3 2013 Game of Show, Titanfall. In addition to our coverage of the game that's already available, the team at Respawn has released a behind the scenes look at the E3 reveal.
Titanfall arrives next year for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

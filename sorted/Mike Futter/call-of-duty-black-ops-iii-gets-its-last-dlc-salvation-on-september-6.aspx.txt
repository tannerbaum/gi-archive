  Call Of Duty: Black Ops III Gets Its Last DLC, Salvation, On September 6






It’s almost time for the Call of Duty torch to be passed once more. Activision has announced the release date for the final Black Ops III DLC.
Salvation includes four maps, and the final chapter of the Origins Zombies cooperative mode story. Treyarch says that the Easter Eggs it has been leaving for players since 2008 will come together in the next installment.
Here’s where you’ll be visiting in the final map pack:

Citadel takes players to a medieval castle. This map features close quarters combat and narrow hallways.
Micro shrinks players down as they fight it out on fully stocked picnic table.
Outlaw is a reimagining of Black Ops II’s Standoff map. This time out, it’s been done up in a wild west theme.
Rupture takes the World at War map Outskirts and dresses it up for Black Ops III’s futuristic setting.

Salvation launches on PlayStation 4 first on September 6. Xbox One and PC will follow later. The DLC is not available on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

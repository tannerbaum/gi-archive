  Celebrate 25 Years Of Civ With Civilization VI Collector’s Edition






For 25 years, we’ve been taking “one more turn,” thanks to Firaxis and designer Sid Meier. This year marks the Civilization franchise’s quarter-century anniversary.
To celebrate, 2K is releasing a collector’s edition of this fall’s Civilization VI. The bundle includes a number of physical items and all of the in-game goods included in the digital deluxe edition.
The collector’s edition comes with a 100-page art book and a commemorative coin set. It’s priced at $90, with only 20,000 copies to be made.

Both the collector box and the digital deluxe edition ($80) include the game, 25th anniversary soundtrack and four post-launch DLC packs that include new Civilizations, maps, scenarios, and leaders. Pre-orders, including both of these versions, get the Aztec civilization. After 90 days, everyone will have access for free.
We suspect that the included DLC won’t be the size of traditional Firaxis big expansions, which might be on the way later (if history is any indication). Civilization VI will be out on October 21 for PC. For more, check out our hands-on coverage from Gamescom.

Our TakeIf you’re planning on picking up the digital deluxe edition and are a diehard Civ fan, the CE is a no-brainer. For $10 extra, you get the art book and the coins. I can’t speak to the quality of the latter, but I’ve always enjoyed the art in the Civ franchise.

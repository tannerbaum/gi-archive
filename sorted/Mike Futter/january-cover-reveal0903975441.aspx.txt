  January Cover Revealed - The Virtual Reality Issue






2016 is the year of virtual reality, as Oculus, Sony, and HTC ready the first home-use displays for sale. With so many questions still looming, we’ve dedicated an entire issue to the technology and software behind what could be one of the most transformative pieces of hardware humanity has seen in decades. 
Oculus, Sony, and HTC are jockeying for an advantage as the three prepare to release their headsets in the first half of the year. Launch lineups are starting to take shape and pricing, while not locked in for any of the three offerings, is coming into focus.
In the latest issue of Game Informer, we sit down with Oculus to discuss the present and future of the Rift, Sony to learn about plans for console-based PlayStation VR, and Valve to get the scoop on the company’s partnership with HTC on the Vive. Inside, you’ll find 52 pages on the upcoming headsets and software.

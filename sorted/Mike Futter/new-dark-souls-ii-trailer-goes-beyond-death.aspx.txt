When Dark Souls was being promoted, it was with the tagline, “Prepare to Die.” Everything we’ve seen about Dark Souls II suggests that death will be an omnipresent force. That’s why we were surprised by this new trailer.
“This is not about death,” it begins. It isn’t until near the end that this sentiment begins to coalesce into the true spirit of From Software’s series.

Dark Souls is about what you learn from death. It’s about taking the mistakes and turning them into lessons.

  The Division’s Next Two Paid Expansions Have Been Delayed






Ubisoft announced today that two upcoming paid expansions for The Division have been delayed. Massive, the lead studio working on the game, is working on feature and gameplay improvements that will happen before the DLC is released.
Survival, the third paid add-on, was supposed to be out this summer. Instead, Massive is taking the time to work on patch 1.4, which it expects will be out in October. That update will include bug patches, systems improvements, and quality of life upgrades.
Between now and then, Ubisoft will be tapping the community for feedback, including bringing some players to Massive in Sweden to help give input. Survival will be out sometime between 1.4 and the end of the calendar year.
Last Stand, the final paid DLC that has been announced, will now be out in early 2017. It was originally scheduled for this winter.

Our TakeDelaying DLC to improve the game experience makes a lot of sense. It’s not an easy decision to make, especially as it creates a gap between major content drops that would otherwise keep existing players engaged. The Division has some systems I really like, but I’d love to see some things tightened up. That seems like what this upcoming patch is set to do.

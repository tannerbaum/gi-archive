  Get An In-Depth Look At The Civilization VI E3 Presentation




There were 70,000 people at E3 last week, and we know there’s a good chance you weren’t one of them. Thankfully, publishers like 2K are delivering a piece of the show floor directly to you.
Narrated by Game of Thrones’ Sean Bean, the 11-minute presentation takes you through some of the big changes coming to the next installment. From the start, you’ll notice a striking aesthetic change for fog of war. The hand-drawn map slowly peels back as you push the edges of your territory.
You may have heard that cities will start to sprawl in Civilization VI. The video gives an overview of how districts can be used to customize each metropolis.

  Spain’s Philip II Is All About Religious Victory In Civilization VI




When Civilization VI launches in October, it will bring with it a new kind of victory. Religion matters right off the bat, and converting more than 50 percent of the population to your faith will give you a win.
Spain’s Philip II is a prime candidate for making a run at the religious victory. With bonuses tied to spreading the empire across a number of continents, Spain and Philip are about rapid expansionism.

The civilization special ability gives additional yield to trade routes between continents. Its special improvement, the Mission, gives bonus faith and even more if its placed on a different continent than the capital city. The Mission also provides bonus science when built next to a campus.
Philip’s leader ability provides a combat bonus against players with a different majority religion. The unique unit, the Conquistador, gets a boost when there’s a missionary, apostle or inquisitor in the same hex. And, if you take an opposing city with a Conquistador in an adjacent hex, it will automatically convert to Spain’s preferred faith.
Civilization VI will be out on October 21, 2016. You can read more about it in our hands-on preview from Gamescom.

  The Inaugural Game Informer Show: Episode 1






The inaugural Game Informer Show – the first in a weekly series – kicks off with a freewheeling discussion of the recent Tokyo Game Show. Hosted by Game Informer senior editor Matt Helgeson, the GI crew that traveled all the way to Japan dish the dirt on the annual game convention. Hear first hand about the show, the announcements, and the best and worst of the games from the people that were there. Later, we talk with GI editors Reiner, Jeff Marchiafava, and Ben Reeves about Halo 3: ODST, to see how the game is holding up since its release. Finally, we’ll get hands-on impressions of Sony PSP Go.

The Game Informer Show will be posted every Thursday, at 6PM CST. So see you again next week.

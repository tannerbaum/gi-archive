  GI Show — Is Skill-Based Matchmaking Good For Games?






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, Ben Reeves, Leo Vader, Brian Shea, and Dan Tack join me to chat about a ton of games, including Persona 5 Royal, Resident Evil 3, Sea of Stars, Gears Tactics, and Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord. The big talker for the show is skill-based matchmaking (SBMM),  and we try to explain how it works and discuss how it affects your game for better or worse. We finish with the always-entertaining and enlightening community emails.

We do this week's show from our homes as we hunker down in quarantine, so please forgive us for any audio or video hiccups as we deliver content outside the studio.

Thanks for listening! Please make sure to leave feedback below, share the episode if you enjoyed it, and follow me @therealandymc to let me know what you think.

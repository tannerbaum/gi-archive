  GI Show – Catching Up With The Last of Us Part II, Crucible, And Ghost of Tsushima






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss The Last of Us Part II, Ghost of Tsushima, Mafia Trilogy, Deep Rock Galactic, and Crucible. And of course, we end this week's show with a fun community segment with emails and games. So please join me, Alex Stadnik, Ben Reeves, and Dan "The Jacket" Tack for another great show.

  GI Show - Death Stranding, Diablo 4, Overwatch 2, Chorus: An Adventure Musical Interview






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show podcast, we ... well, we go long. Way long. But this week's show is packed with content. First, I sit down with Joe Juba and Matthew Kato to discuss perhaps one of the most debated triple-A games ever released, Death Stranding. 

Next up, we knock out all four games that grace the cover of Game Informer issue 320: Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, and Hearthstone: Descent of Dragons. This segment features an all-star cast of Game Informer editors who traveled to Blizzard's HQ to play the games and spent days with the team, learning about these blockbuster titles. 

In this week's community email segment Ben Reeves, Dan Tack, and Matt Miller answer questions and I tell an old tale. Emails are fun and irreverent as always. 

In our final segment, I talk with Liam Ester, managing director, and David Gaider, creative director, of Summerfall Studios, who recently hit their fundraising goal on fig.co for their upcoming title, Chorus: An Adventure Musical. It is an interesting talk about how they applying their passion for musicals with their long history with role-playing games. If you are interested in learning more or donating, hit this link. Summerfall also released a playable proof of concept today.

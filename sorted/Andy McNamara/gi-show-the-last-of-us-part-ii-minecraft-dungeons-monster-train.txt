  GI Show - The Last of Us Part II State of Play, Minecraft Dungeons, and Monster Train






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss The Last of Us Part II's recent State of Play where we finally see some uninterrupted gameplay, and we cover the recent reviews of Minecraft Dungeons and Monster Train. Of course, we end this week's show with a fun community segment full of emails and games. So please join me, Alex Stadnik, Jeff Cork, and Dan "The Jacket" Tack for another great show.

We continue to do this show from our homes as we hunker down in quarantine, so please forgive us for any audio or video hiccups as we deliver content outside the studio.

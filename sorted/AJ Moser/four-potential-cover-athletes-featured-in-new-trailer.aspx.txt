FIFA 17


  Four Potential Cover Athletes Featured In New Trailer




FIFA 17 is bringing a lot of new features to the popular soccer series, as well as being the first EA Sports title to utilize DICE's Frostbite engine. The athlete that graces the game's cover will be decided by fans in an online voting contest. 
The game's reveal trailer included four global ambassadors, recognizable pro players that helped EA work on the gameplay and will be available in FIFA Ultimate Team. These previously announced players, James Rodriguez of Real Madrid C.F., Anthony Martial of Manchester United, Eden Hazard of Chelsea FC, and Marco Reus of Borussia Dortmund are the options for the game's cover. A new trailer, seen below, shows off each of them in action.

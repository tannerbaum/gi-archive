Fans of the Dragon Ball series have plenty to be excited in the next Dragon Ball Xenoverse game. The title is bringing high-powered fighters to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.  
An extended demo unveiled at E3 shows off what a standard battle in the game will look like. Fans of the first Xenoverse game know what to expect from the sequel, but the focus on current-gen hardware ensures a continuous 60 frames per second and detailed environments. We also learned that user-created characters are going to present in the game. See Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 in action below.

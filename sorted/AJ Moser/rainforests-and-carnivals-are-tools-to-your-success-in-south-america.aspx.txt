A unique bonus for Brazil are the rainforests surrounding the various cities you can build. They will grant extra resources if left adjacent to developments, presenting players with the option to tear them down or leave them standing. The carnival district is also unique to Brazil, granting boosts for its citizens. 
Pedro II and the Brazilian Empire join the Egyptians, Aztecs, French and even more factions in Civilization VI. The game launches for PC on October 21.

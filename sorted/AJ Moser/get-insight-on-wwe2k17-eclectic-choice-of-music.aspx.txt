In addition to a roster of the biggest names in wresting, the WWE games usually include a soundtrack full of up-and-coming artists as well as proven classics. The soundtrack for this year's WWE 2K17 is no exception, full of songs and artists curated by Sean "Diddy" Combs. 
The soundtrack will span hip-hop, rock, and electronic music. 2K has also released a video interview with Combs, explaining his reasoning behind the song choices and his experience producing the soundtrack for a video game. Check out the interview and full tracklist below.

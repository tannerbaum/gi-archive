The game follows Hatsune Miku as she attempts to restore the world's fading light by traveling through the Classic, Cute, Cool, Elegant, and Quirky clouds. The difficulty in the full game can ramp up to hard and extreme modes as well. For players to succeed and get the highest score possible, they will need to construct the right outfit using over 300 accessories. 
This will also be the first time players can customize their own Hatsune Miku shows in their homes. The concert editor allows players to pick the setting, effects, lighting, and camera movements and watch their own show play out.
Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X hits PlayStation 4 and Vita on August 30. The game's demo will be available on August 9.

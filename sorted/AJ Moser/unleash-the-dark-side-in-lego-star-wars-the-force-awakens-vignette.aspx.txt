Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens


  Unleash The Dark Side In Short Vignette 




Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens launches next week, bringing an adaptation of the latest film with the traditional Lego charm. The latest teaser for the game shows off the villainous Kylo Ren in action.  
In this footage, we get to see some moments directly from the movie recreated with Lego characters. Kylo Ren is still voiced by Adam Driver, and we see his interrogation of Rey and a humorous twist on his interaction in a village on Jakku. Check out the new footage below.

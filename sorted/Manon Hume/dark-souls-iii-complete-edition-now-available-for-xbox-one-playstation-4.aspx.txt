  Dark Souls III Complete Edition Now Available For Xbox One, PlayStation 4






With the release of Dark Souls III's The Ringed City DLC, the content drip for this dark fantasy RPG series has come to an end. A complete version of the last entry in the trilogy, fittingly titled The Fire Fades Edition, is now available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
Priced at $49.99, The Fire Fades Edition includes the core Dark Souls III game bundled with the game's two DLC additions: Ashes of Ariandel, which introduced the Painted World of Ariandel, the Hollow Arena PvP map, and new bosses and items, and The Ringed City, which added a whole new region for players to explore.Â

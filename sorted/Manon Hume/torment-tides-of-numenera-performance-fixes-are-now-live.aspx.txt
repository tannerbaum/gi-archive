  Torment: Tides Of Numenera Performance Fixes Are Now Live






Taking place one billion years in the future, the sci-fi world of Torment: Tides of Numenera is unlike anything we know. Today, players on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be able to explore the game's strange setting with fewer issues thanks to a performance update released by inXile.
InXile has taken note of community feedback since Torment's launch at the end of February, with the new patch addressing various performance bugs and issues. Freezes have been patched, party member dialogue restored, and A.I. combat has been improved, while other fixes add more descriptive text for items found in the game. Full patch notes can be found here.

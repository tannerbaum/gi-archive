  Riot Games Teases New League Of Legends Champions






League of Legends boasts well over 100 characters for players to choose from. Today, Riot Games has released a trailer showing two more, Xayah and Rakan.
Both characters are members of a new in-game race known as the Vastaya, who have a bird-like design that is reflected in their feather magic. As shown in the trailer below, Xayah is a damage-dealing character whose feathers can pierce multiple enemies, while Rakan provides support with feather-shields and distractions.

Though no time frame has yet been announced for the release of Xayah and Rakan, character bios for the pair can be found on the League of Legends website here.
Check out other recent League of Legends news, such as Riot Games' recent lawsuit victory against a bot website and fellow champion Yasuo's sword being recreated in the Man At Arms YouTube series.

Our TakeIt's always great to have new champions to play, and the Vastaya add some cool lore to the game. We'll have to wait and see how Xayah and Rakan fare once they're released, but typically new champions mean new meta, so this could bring some changes to League of Legends' competitive play.Â

  Super Mario Toys Make Their Way To McDonald's






With the upcoming release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Nintendo is bringing the Mario crew to McDonald's happy meals. Toy figures of Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Luigi, and the iconic red plumber himself will be included in every meal from now until May 22. Just remember to watch out for the red Koopa shell!
During that same time, hungry fans can enter a sweepstakes for a Nintendo Switch bundled with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe using codes from their meals. Happy meal purchases provide two codes, while other purchases give one. Details for the contest can be found at McDonald's website here.

  Star Trek Online Season 12 Reckoning Expansion Comes To Consoles






Star Trek Online is a free-to-play MMORPG that casts players as captains of their own starship, allowing them to explore the Star Trek universe. With the release of Star Trek Online Season 12: Reckoning, console players of the game now have more to discover as they face off against a new foe that threatens all life: The Tzenkethi.
The latest expansion brings the Tzenkethi storyline to the game, which is reflected in the new content. An episode known as 'Of Signs and Portents' has players team up with Lukari and Klingon forces against the Tzenkethi, while the new Lukari Restoration Initiative reputation earns players gear that protects against Tzenkethi technology. Other additions include two space queues and a space battlezone, both related to the war against the Tzenkethi.

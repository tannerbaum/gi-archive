  Prison Architect Is Coming To Mobile Devices






When it comes to Prison Architect, the phrase "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen" couldn't be more fitting. Tasking players with juggling jail construction, inmates' morale, guards' pay, and dozens of other variables to avoid riots and jailbreaks, Introversion Software's management simulator is now coming to mobile.
A collaboration between developer Introversion and publisher Paradox Interactive, Prison Architect: Mobile will be available for both iOS and Android devices. The game will be free to download with additional content and game modes available for in-game purchase. Though no release date has yet been announced for the U.S., a limited number of players in the Netherlands can find an early version of the title on Google Play and the App Store.Â

Our TakeConsidering how complex the systems of Prison Architect are and how huge the prison layout can become, bringing the game to mobile seems daunting. Hopefully the "early access" players can help hammer out the best way to translate Prison Architect across platforms.

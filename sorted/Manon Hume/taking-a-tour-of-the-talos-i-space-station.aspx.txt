Previous trailers of Prey have answered the who, what, and how of the game: who is Morgan Yu, what are some of the aliens will players face, and how can weapons and powers be used to destroy them? The latest trailer for the sci-fi shooter focuses on the "where" as Arkane Studios takes players on a guided tour of the Talos I space station.
Featuring commentary from key figures behind the game's development, the trailer below shows off the diverse environments housed within Talos I and how they relate to gameplay. Some areas are full of luxurious red carpets with plenty of classy furniture for Mimics to copy, while others have no oxygen and allow Morgan to maneuver in zero gravity. Players can even leave the station and explore the space outside, which the developers say can eventually be used to quickly navigate between different areas of the station.

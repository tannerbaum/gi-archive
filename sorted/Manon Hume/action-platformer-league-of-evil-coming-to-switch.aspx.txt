  Action-Platformer League Of Evil Coming To Switch






When the world's evil scientists band together to form the League of Evil, there's only one thing to do: send a bionic super-soldier to wall jump and dive kick his way through their evil plans. Originally released for iOS in 2011 by Woblyware, developer Ratalaika Games hinted on Twitter today that Switch users can now look forward to taking on the brainy organization themselves.
Ratalaika Games first ported the challenging 2D platformer to PC last year. In addition to the game's core 140 missions spread across four chapters, the PC version added exclusive content and a level editor for players to create and share custom stages. These fan-made levels are free to download and were intended to be shared cross-platform between the PC port and planned ports to Wii U and 3DS. Ratalaika stated that a press release with more details will be released later this week.
Check out another potential upcoming port, Vanquish, as well as the recently-announced Jackbox Party Pack 4.

Our TakeThe Switch seems like a good platform for a Super Meat Boy-type platforming challenge, but it's unclear what this announcement means for the ports planned for Wii U and 3DS. Guess we'll have to wait and see what the press release has in store.

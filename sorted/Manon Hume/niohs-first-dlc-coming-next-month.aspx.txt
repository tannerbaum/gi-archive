  Nioh's First DLC Coming Next Month






Channeling the spirit of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, Nioh has been challenging players since the game first launched in February. Dragon of the North, the game's first DLC, will add more opportunities for players to face-off against difficult foes beginning on May 2nd.
Available as a stand-alone purchase or as part of the game's season pass, Dragon of the North adds an additional area to the game for players to explore. Called the Oshu region, this stage introduces new yokai enemy types, as well as new weapons and equipment. The DLC also brings a PvP game mode to Nioh.

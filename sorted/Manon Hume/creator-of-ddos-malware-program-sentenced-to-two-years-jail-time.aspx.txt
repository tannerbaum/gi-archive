  Creator Of DDoS Malware Program Sentenced To Two Years' Jail Time






The Central Criminal Court of England and Wales found 20-year-old Adam Mudd guilty after he admitted to creating a malware program designed to perform "distributed denial of service" (DDoS) attacks on computer networks. Mudd's Titanium Stresser malware is thought to have caused 1.7 million cyber attacks since its creation in 2013.
Mudd sold the malware under a pseudonym, accumulating nearly $400,000 from his 112,000 registered users. Included in the estimated 666,000 IP addresses that have been attacked by Titanium Stresser are several high-profile gaming companies, such as Microsoft's Xbox Live services, Minecraft, and the MMORPG Runescape. The DDoS attacks from Titanium Stresser overloaded these companies' networks with too much data, interrupting their connection to the Internet and leaving them unable to process user requests.Â 
In an effort to make the sentence a strong deterrent to future cyber criminals, the judge sentenced Mudd to two years of jail, which will be served in a young offenders' institution.

Our TakeDDoS attacks are becoming more of a problem in the gaming industry as cyber criminals target companies' networks for their own gain. Though two years isn't the strongest deterrent, hopefully Mudd's arrest and sentence will call attention to this issue and discourage the practice.

  Gore Verbinski Discusses Cancelled BioShock Movie






Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the upcoming A Cure For Wellness, is known for his stunning visual style and strange, immersive worlds. Fans of the BioShock game were thrilled when Verbinski was chosen to direct a film adaptation of the mad world of Rapture, an underwater utopia gone violently wrong, back in 2009. These eager fans were then disappointed when the project was cancelled in 2011 only eight weeks before filming and Verbinski stepped down as director.
In an Ask Me Anything (AMA) post on Reddit, one user asked Verbinski to elaborate on what had happened to the film. The director responded that there was no short answer, but cited the movie's R rating and budget as the main factors that led Universal to drop the project. 
"It's an R rated movie. I wanted to keep it R rated, I felt like that would be appropriate, and it's an expensive movie. It's a massive world we're creating and it's not a world we can simply go to locations to shoot," he explained. "We'd be building an entire underworld universe. So I think the combination of the price tag and the rating, universal just didn't feel comfortable ultimately."
Despite these obstacles, many users continue to hope that some day, they can visit BioShock through the world of cinema. His upcoming movie, A Cure For Wellness, has some scenes of underwater terror, which makes us wonder if some of his unused BioShock ideas will surface here.

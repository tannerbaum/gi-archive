  Darli Dagger Gets First Gameplay Trailer For Samurai Shodown






Darli Dagger, the first new Samurai Shodown fighter in years, was revealed during PAX East earlier this month, but no footage was shown at the time. SNK today gave us a glimpse of her moveset and style in her reveal trailer.

Darli is a pirate fighter that, after washing ashore as a young girl, learned to defend herself against dangerous local pirates. Fortunately her defense is aided by a gigantic saw blade and some sort of large drill.

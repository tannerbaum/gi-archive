  Horror Anthology The Dark Pictures Gets New Developer Diary






Supermassive Games, developers of the PlayStation 4 horror game Until Dawn, is working on an anthology series titled The Dark Pictures. The first episode, Man of Medan, is slated for release sometime in 2019, but to showcase some of what the team has been working on, there is a new developer diary to check out. It's only a few minutes long, but it dives into the work behind the boat's physics, and what went into capturing accurate audio out on the open ocean.

A huge amount of work went into not only recording all the audio of a boat in a storm, but also the animations of a character on a turbulent boat ride. Little is said about the actual narrative direction or characters, but you can see some glimpses of the game in action.

If you can't wait to see what the team has in store, take a look at the video. You can also watch the first dev diary on the game's sound design, or read our hands-on with the game.

            Starting tomorrow, April 2, PlayStation 4 players will have access to a whole new map in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's battle royale mode, Blackout.

The map is only coming out tomorrow on PS4 with Xbox One and PC having to sit this out for now (though it should be coming on the other platforms soon), but players on all systems will have access to the free month of Blackout. And according to our Dan Tack's review, it's worth your time.

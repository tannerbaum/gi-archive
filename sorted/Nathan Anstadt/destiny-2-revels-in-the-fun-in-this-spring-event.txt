  Destiny 2 Revels In The Fun In This Spring Event






For a limited time – April 16 to May 6 – all Destiny 2 players will see the game's central tower has been decked out for spring in the upcoming Revelry event. Flowers are in bloom and the forests are verdant. That Verdant Forest will actually be an area for players to complete quests and bounties during this time and unlock rewards like new armor.

In the Forest you will come up against five bosses while fighting against the clock, but the more rooms you clear leading up to those encounters, the more time you'll have against the bosses.

This seems like more than a new coat of paint, so get in there and have some fun in the sun while you still can. Bungie recently buffed quite a few subclasses, but you can read our review of Destiny 2: Forsaken that our own Matt Miller thoroughly enjoyed.

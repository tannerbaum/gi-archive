Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery


  New Teaser Shows Off More Of Hogwarts




Back in January, Portkey Games, the arm of Warner Brothers dedicated to publishing Harry Potter titles, revealed that indie developer Jam City was working on a mobile RPG set in the universe. This game is notable because, despite the confusing title, Harry Potter doesn't show up anywhere in it. This is a prequel game set years before the events of the book, where you get to run around as a student of one of the houses.
Today Portkey and Jam City revealed a new teaser that shows off more gameplay features, including potion making and wizard duels. You can watch the whole thing here:

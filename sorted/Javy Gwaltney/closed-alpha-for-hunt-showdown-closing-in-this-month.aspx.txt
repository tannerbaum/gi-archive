  Closed Alpha For Hunt: Showdown Closing In This Month






Hunt: Showdown was one of the biggest surprises we played at E3. We loved the game's tense focus on survival, gothic atmosphere, tracking, and use of permadeath. And now, it looks like you'll have the option to find out for yourself if this hardcore multiplayer is for you.
Developer Crytek announced today that the game will enter closed alpha at the end of the month:
Starting on Jan. 31, a select group of PC gamers will be able to play Hunt: Showdown regularly as part of the game’s closed alpha testing phase via Steam. During closed alpha, the Hunt team will be testing gameplay, balancing, and backend functionality, as well as collecting feedback from the community. Closed alpha testers will be randomly chosen from the sign-up list, and those chosen will receive an email invite.
Those interested in signing up for a chance at getting an invite can do so here. For more on Hunt: Showdown, check out five reasons why editor Matt Bertz dug his time with it so much here.

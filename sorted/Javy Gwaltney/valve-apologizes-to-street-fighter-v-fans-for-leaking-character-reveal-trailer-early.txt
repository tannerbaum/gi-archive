  Valve Apologizes To Street Fighter V Fans For Leaking Character Reveal Trailer Early






Earlier this week, Capcom revealed that three fan-favorite characters were coming to Street Fighter V except..well, the problem is the company didn't reveal it. Steam leaked it early thanks to a scheduling snafu.

Valve has since apologized for the incident in the Community Hub for Street Fighter V on Steam:

On Wednesday of this week there was a mix-up in the publishing process at Valve that caused a trailer to go live on Steam ahead of schedule. The trailer includes the major reveal of Poison, Lucia, and E. Honda as characters joining the fighter roster. 

It’s a regrettable and unintentional situation, and we have already implemented measures to prevent this error from happening again. We are fans of Street Fighter ourselves and we’re sorry for the error. 

-The Steam Team

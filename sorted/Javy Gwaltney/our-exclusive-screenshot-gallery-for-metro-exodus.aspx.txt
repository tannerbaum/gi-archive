  Our Exclusive Screenshot Gallery For Metro Exodus






Metro Exodus is making some big changes to 4A's formerly claustrophobic series (you can read all about them here!). The developer is also upping the ante visually, making one of the best looking video games look even better. We got the chance to go to the studio recently and see the game for ourselves and were blown away by how stunning the environments and particle effects looked. Don't take my word for it though: you can see for yourself down below with this bevy of exclusive screens. If you want to see a full-size version of them, just click on the screen below.
This is a shot of the open expanse from the spring area you travel to early on in the game. Referred to as "The Bridge" during our demo, we watched Artyom cross snow-covered plains to tangle with technology-wary cultists and mutants in order to lower a bridge so the Aurora, the train that Artyom and company are using to cross Russia, can continue its journey.
Before that section, however, Exodus begins with Artyom back in good old Moscow, doing what does best: fumbling through encounters with monsters and somehow surviving.
Details for character models have clearly been enhanced since Last Light, including Artyom's body now visible from the first-person perspective as you play.
4A's in-house engine continues to produce fantastic visual effects when it comes to lighting and shadows, creating a beautiful scene even when you're inside a cramped, decaying building.
Metro's version of Moscow in Exodus remains as it always has throughout the series: hauntingly beautiful.

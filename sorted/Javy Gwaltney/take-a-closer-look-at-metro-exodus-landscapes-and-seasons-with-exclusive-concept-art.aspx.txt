  Take A Closer Look At Metro Exodus With This Exclusive Concept Art






The Metro series has rightfully earned praise over the years for its eye-popping visuals. However, most of the environments have often taken placed in cramped, dark spaces. With Metro going much bigger with open-world, the spaces the player inhabit are changing radically, trading sewers and tunnels for icy plains and mountains. This week we're taking a look at the concept art of the places Artyom visits in Exodus, as well as some of the foes he encounters.
Seasons

The game kicks off in the winter, with Artyom and the Spartans leaving Moscow. Metro's always been good at making Russia's capital look fantastic, but Exodus' shots of the city are breathtaking, doing justice by this beautiful concept art.

Spring finds Artyom and company on some icy plains near a lift bridge. The majority of gameplay footage we saw during our took place here, and was filled with broken buildings containing bandits and cultists who worship a giant fish in a lake (don't ask).

The summer season of the game is the most radical departure from what players typically associate with Metro, taking place in a desert and giving off a Mad Max vibe.

The autumn section of the trip cuts through red and green forests and mountains, with this piece of artwork capturing the lushness of the environment we saw in-game. The area has rushing rivers, a cave network, and many human fortifications that look forboding. 
Enemies And Allies

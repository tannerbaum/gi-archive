  Dragon Ball FighterZ Instantaneously Transmits To Switch This September






            It's time to punch Freiza in his stupid face once again but this time, you get to do it while on the go. Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally coming to Switch and will be arriving on the platform pretty soon, actually.

You'll be able to KA-ME-HA-ME-HA everywhere you go starting September 28. Those who preorder the game on Switch will receive early access to SSGSS Goku & Vegeta.

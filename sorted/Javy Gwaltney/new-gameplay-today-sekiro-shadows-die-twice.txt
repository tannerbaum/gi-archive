  New Gameplay Today â€“ Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice






            From Software's raised more than a few eyebrows when it announced that its new game was Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, a title that has nothing to do with Dark Souls or Bloodborne. However, we finally managed to get some hands-on time with the title (you can read Ben's impressions here) and take a look at it to see what we think.

Here's me, Dan Tack, and Leo "The Man Himself" Vader talking about footage from the Gamescom demo supplied by Suriel Vazquez, who stabs a bunch of dudes and takes on a giant ugly looking guy.

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is due out on March 22 for PS4 and Xbox One.

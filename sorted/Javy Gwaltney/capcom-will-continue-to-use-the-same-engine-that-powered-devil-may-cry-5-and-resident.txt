  Capcom Will Continue To Use The Same Engine That Powered Devil May Cry 5 And Resident Evil 2






At its recent financial earnings report, Capcom answered a number of questions about the company's plans for the future. Amidst technical questions about percentage profit increases and share buybacks, were two interesting questions about the RE Engine, which has powered the likes of Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 2 Remake, and Devil May Cry 5.

When asked how many games were on the way that used that tech, Capcom opted for a informative yet vague answer, saying, "While we are unable to comment on the specific number of titles or release windows, there are numerous titles currently being developed internally with the RE ENGINE." 

However, the most interesting part of Capcom's report was when the company spoke a tad more in-depth about its plans for the future with the engine: 

The games we developed using the RE ENGINE during this current hardware generation have received critical acclaim, and from the early stages of building this engine, we kept the ability to augment it for next-generation development in mind; as such, we view the RE ENGINE as one of our strengths that will contribute to next-generation game creation.

While on the surface-level this reinforces the earlier answer that more games are on the way with the RE Engine, the "next-generation" line implies that we'll be seeing games on the next generation consoles made with the engine.

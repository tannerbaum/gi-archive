Hot on the heels of releasing Sky: Children Of Light, Thatgamecompany has even more news. The former Sony exclusive gem Journey is now available to play on iOS.

The iOS version of the game will run you $5. It does not sound like an Android version is in the works, at least not one by Annapurna:

tbd for Steam, and the only platforms we did the port for are PC and iOS

  Dead Island 2 Changes Developers Once Again






Over the past few years, Dead Island 2 has emerged as one of the industry's biggest question marks. The game was announced in 2014, with Yager Development (Spec Ops: The Line) taking over the reins from Techland, which had left its tropical undead shores Dying Light.

After a press showing at Gamescom 2014, Deep Silver revealed a year later that Yager was no longer developing the project. Sumo Digital, best known for Team Sonic Racing and work on Crackdown 3, took over development in 2016. Today, THQ Nordic revealed in a financial report that a new driver is in the seat once more, with Dambuster Studios (Homefront: The Revolution) have taken over development:

 We have entrusted Dambuster Studios with the Dead Island franchise, bringing the development of this key franchise to one of our internal studios. They are now leading the development of Dead Island 2.

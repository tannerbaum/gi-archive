  New Gameplay Today – Observation






            Scottish developer No Code, formed by developers who worked on Alien Isolation, won big in 2017 with Stories Untold, a creepy and stylish horror adventure. This year, the company is bringing its audience to the horrors of space with Observation, a game where you play as an artificial intelligence on a space station where things have gone terribly wrong.

We got to play the first hour of the game, which is a pretty neat combination of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you want to see why Observation is a game you should be keeping an eye on, watch the first 45 minutes of the game above.

For more on No Code's games, check out our review of Stories Untold. Observation releases May 22 on PC and PS4.

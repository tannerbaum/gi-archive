The clever gameplay requires players to feed the friendly Blob different flavored jelly beans to induce transformations into different objects. The Wii version, which was a reimagining of 1989's A Boy And His Blob: Trouble On Blobolonia, was well-received upon release and made our top 25 Wii games list.

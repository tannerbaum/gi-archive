  Capcom Showcase E3 2021 Watch Along With Game Informer






            The E3 2021 announcements continue with today's Capcom Showcase, which we already know will be revealing new looks at Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. Additionally, Capcom has confirmed we'll see Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise in some regard. Of course, it wouldn't be E3 without a few surprises, so join Alex Stadnik, Marcus Stewart, and yours truly for a Capcom Showcase watch along beginning at 4:15 p.m. Central over on the Game Informer Twitch Page.

Resident Evil fans could potentially have a lot to be excited about. According to a Capcom leak back in November, the team is hard at work on several new projects related to the classic horror series. Resident Evil 4 is apparently getting the same makeover treatment as the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. According to the leaks, a Resident Evil Village multiplayer component is in development that could bring battle royale offerings to the game.

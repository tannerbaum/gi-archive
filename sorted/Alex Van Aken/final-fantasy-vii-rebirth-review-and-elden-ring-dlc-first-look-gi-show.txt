  Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Review And Elden Ring DLC First Look | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew breaks down what has been a busy few days in the video game industry. We dive into our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, recap the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree release date trailer, and share highlights from another Nintendo Direct. Additionally, we discuss our time playing Princess Peach: Showtime, Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and Balatro, a new poker roguelite (a "Pokerlite?") we can't seem to put down.

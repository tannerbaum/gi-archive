  Best Indie Games of 2022, Scorn, And Signalis Preview | GI Show (Feat. Jill Grodt)






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, special guest and former Game Informer editor Jill Grodt joins us to talk about the best indie games of 2022 (so far) and a retro-inspired survival horror game, Signalis, that is blowing Alex away. Also, Wesley explains why he isn't enjoying Scorn, the slippery and wet puzzle game we all thought was a first-person shooter. Lastly, Jill talks about her new indie game website, The Indie Informer, and shares what she's been up to since departing Game Informer earlier this year.

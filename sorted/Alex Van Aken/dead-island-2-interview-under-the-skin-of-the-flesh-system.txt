  Dead Island 2 Interview – Under The Skin Of The FLESH System






            At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to James Worrall and Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about the long-awaited sequel, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

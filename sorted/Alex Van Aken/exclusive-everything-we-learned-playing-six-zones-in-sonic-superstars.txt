  Exclusive: Everything We Learned Playing Six Zones In Sonic Superstars






            Last month I visited Sonic Team's new headquarters in Burbank, CA, alongside Game Informer's Brian Shea, who's now played half of Sonic Superstars. The upcoming 2D platformer brings Sonic The Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy back for a new cooperative adventure — however, I'd like to note we only engaged with the single-player experience. After our several-hour hands-on play session, we sat in my hotel room to break down our time playing six of Superstars' 12 zones, including details about each level, boss fights, the signature Emerald Powers, and how the platforming physics behaved.

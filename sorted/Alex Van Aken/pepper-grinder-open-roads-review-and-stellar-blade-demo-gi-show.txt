  Pepper Grinder, Open Roads Review, And Stellar Blade Demo | GI Show






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses our time playing the public demo of Stellar Blade, the character action game formerly known as Project Eve. We drill into Pepper Grinder, the latest title from Devolver Digital, and then discuss a rad town-building sandbox called Summerhouse. After highlighting Stunt Paradise, a small game that fans of the Trials series might enjoy, we steer the conversation towards Marcus' Open Roads review and how the title compares to Gone Home and Tacoma.

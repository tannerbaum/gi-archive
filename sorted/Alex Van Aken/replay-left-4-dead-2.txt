  Replay – Left 4 Dead 2






            In the first Replay episode of the year, the Game Informer crew plays through the second installment in Valve's iconic zombie series, Left 4 Dead 2. Join Andrew Reiner, Liana Ruppert, Kim Wallace, and myself for an FPS romp through the game's first campaign, during which we navigate a hotel that's engulfed in flames, zombie-infested city streets, and the scariest shopping mall you could ever conceive. 

Are you feeling excited about zombie shooters again? Be sure to check out our coverage of Back 4 Blood, the spiritual successor to L4D from the team at Turtle Rock Studios, where we discuss our impressions of the game so far and show it off on a recent episode of New Gameplay Today Live.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

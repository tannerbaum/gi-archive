  Horizon Forbidden West Review And Nintendo eShop Closures | GI Show (Feat. Greg Miller)






            On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew is joined by Kinda Funny's Greg Miller to discuss Horizon Forbidden West review impressions and the upcoming Nintendo eShop closures on 3DS and Wii U systems. We also briefly discuss our time playing Lost Ark, Rune Factory 5, and OlliOlli World. Lastly, a listener question sparks a conversation about which video game characters we would draft as the new Suicide Squad – and my controversial pick might surprise you!

Spoiler: I chose Tingle because I hate that creepy video game toddler man and hope we finally bury him.

            Horizon Forbidden West Review Discussion

            Horizon Forbidden West improves the first game's experience in almost every way. Traversal options are more varied and fluid, fights with the machines are more dynamic than before, and excellent side quests populate huge open-world environments. Our reviewer, Kimberly Wallace, chats with Alex Stadnik and special guest Greg Miller about their experiences playing the project that sets a new standard for developer Guerilla Games.

            Game Informer Staff discuss the games they're playing.

            This week's iteration of The Playlist is more brief than usual; nonetheless, we're eager to chat about the games we've been playing. Alex Van Aken laughs at the dichotomy of League of Legends' highly competitive environment and its relaxing effect on his evenings, Stadnik can't seem to put OlliOlli World down, and Kim shares more about her recent time playing Rune Factory 5, which releases next month.

            We debuted exclusive Elden Ring gameplay earlier today as part of our cover story on From Software's upcoming Soulslike title. The footage showcased Castle Mourne, a never-before-seen area nestled in southern Limgrave on the Weeping Penninsula, featuring gargantuan armor-clad archers, grizzly chimeric monsters, and an optional boss fight.

  The Game Awards Predictions And Super Mario RPG Review | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses our predictions for The Game Awards' category winners and game reveals, Alex's unofficial Modern Warfare III multiplayer review, Kyle's Super Mario RPG remake review, and what it's like starting the Like A Dragon series with The Man Who Erased His Name. Before diving into this week's listener questions, which spark discussions about gaming room must-haves and the secret to long-lasting game franchises, Marcus tells us about The Last Faith, another Castlevania-inspired action game worth trying if you have time.

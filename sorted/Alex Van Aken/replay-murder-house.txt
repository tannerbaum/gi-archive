  Replay – Murder House






            Murder House, developed by Puppet Combo, is one of the most intriguing indie horror games of 2020. Set in the 1980s, a renowned serial killer called The Easter Ripper stalks a local news station team as they investigate the very home wherein he murdered his unfortunate victims.

In this new episode of Replay, join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, Dan Tack, and me as we play Murder House, an indie survival horror Steam game that's inspired by PS1 classics like Silent Hill and Resident Evil.

If you enjoyed this frightening Replay then be sure to check out our recent episodes featuring Dead Space 2 or Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

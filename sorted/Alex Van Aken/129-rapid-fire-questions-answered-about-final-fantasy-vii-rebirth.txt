  129 Rapid-Fire Questions Answered About Final Fantasy VII Rebirth






            Game Informer asked Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's game director, Naoki Hamaguchi, 129 rapid-fire questions about the party's next adventure while visiting Creative Business Unit I during our recent cover story trip in Tokyo. During our chat, we inquired about the original Final Fantasy 7's rumored N64 version, Zack's importance in the remake, whether mainline entries will ever return to Nintendo consoles, and 126 other burning questions. Oh, and we also try to guess the next game's subtitle. My money is on "Reloaded."

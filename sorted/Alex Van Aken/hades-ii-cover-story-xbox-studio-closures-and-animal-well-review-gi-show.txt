  Hades II Cover Story, Xbox Studio Closures, And Animal Well Review | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss our Hades II cover story trip to Supergiant Games in San Francisco and Xbox shutting down four game studios, including Prey, Dishonored, and Redfall developer Arkane Austin, alongside Tango Gameworks, the team behind The Evil Within series and last year's critically-acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush. Afterward, we chat about Shuntaro Furukawa, President of Nintendo, revealing the company will reveal details about the Nintendo Switch's successor within this fiscal year via a post on X. Before diving into our positive reviews of '90s-survival-horror Crow Country and Little Kitty, Big City, special guest Charlie Wacholz joins us to chat about his Animal Well review, in which he calls Bigmode's first published title "a masterclass in environmental design."

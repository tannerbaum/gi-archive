  Stray Review, Live A Live, And Game Informer Updates | GI Show






            In this episode of The Game Informer Show, Alex Van Aken takes over as host following Alex Stadnik's departure last week, and Jill Grodt leaves Game Informer of her own will following the recent layoffs of our staff. In a surprising turn, Wesley LeBlanc announces his return to Game Informer as Associate Editor. After these updates, the crew dives into the week's video game releases and discusses our Stray review with Blake Hester and why cats are a novel subject in video games. Rounding out the show, we chat about Live A Live and Saints Row with Andrew Reiner.

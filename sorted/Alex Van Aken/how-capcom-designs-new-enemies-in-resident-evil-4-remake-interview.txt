            As part of this month's cover story, we sat with Art Director Hirofumi Nakaoka to learn how Capcom designs old and new enemies in Resident Evil 4 (Remake). You'll learn about scrapped redesigns for the iconic chainsaw villager, how normalcy breeds horror, and how Nakaoka and the team created a new cow-headed, hammer-wielding villager referred to as The Brute. And folks looking for new Resident Evil 4 gameplay have some new footage to dissect in this video interview.

  Exclusive Look At Saints Row's Opening Missions | New Gameplay Today






            We got to go hands-on with the open world antics of the Saints Row reboot for this month's cover story (which digital subscribers can read right now) which included two story missions set early on in the game. In this edition of New Gameplay Today, you can watch our exclusive gameplay from these missions, featuring the hard-hitting car chases from "Making Rent," followed by a good old-fashioned saloon brawl and subsequent creative interrogation methods in "Idol Threat." Join Brian Shea, Alex Van Aken, and John Carson as they talk about these missions and their time with an early demo of Saints Row. 

Please note that this Saints Row gameplay is pre-alpha footage supplied by Deep Silver and represents a game still in development.

  Unprecedented GTA 6 Leaks And EA Motive's Iron Man Game | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, special guest Matt Storm joins Alex Van Aken and Brian Shea to break down the unprecedented Grand Theft Auto 6 leaks that happened over the weekend. In what is one of the largest video game leaks of all time, over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel were leaked on GTAForums and quickly spread via fans on YouTube and social media. 

Additionally, we chat about this week's news of a collaboration between Marvel Games and EA Motive to develop a single-player Iron Man game. During The Playlist, we dive into our time playing Splatoon 3, TemTem, and Metal: Hellsinger.

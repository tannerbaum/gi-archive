  Installing The Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1UP In Our Home Arcade






            Arcade1UP sent us the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet to set up in Brian Shea’s home arcade. Luring me to his house with promises of trading Pokémon Cards, I brought my camera to Shea’s house to film him unboxing and building the cabinet. Don’t worry; we sped up the build and captured Shea’s first impressions on camera. 

Thanks for watching, and happy holidays!

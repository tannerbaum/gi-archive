  Amazon MMO New World Coming To Consoles With Major Updates






            Announced during today’s Summer Game Fest broadcast, Amazon Games is bringing its action role-playing MMO, New World, to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via an enhanced cross-play-enabled version. Debuting on October 15, 2024, New World: Aeternum features the entire base game and its previous updates while revamping the story, dialogue, and leveling experience. 

Additionally, the pseudo-expansion introduces new content like a large-scale PvP zone, 10-player raid, new classes, end-game solo challenges, updated control schemes, and new gear, of course.

Amazon has confirmed to Game Informer that future updates will arrive day-and-date for PC and console players. New users will be able to purchase New World: Aeternum’s Standard Edition for $59.99 or the Deluxe Edition for $79.99, while PC players who own the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC will receive a free upgrade.

  The Last Of Us HBO Reactions And More Games Industry Layoffs | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, host Alex Van Aken returns from a secret trip to Japan with Marcus Stewart. The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO's The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 

During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they've been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

  Starfield Vs. Baldur's Gate 3 And Why It's Okay To Disagree | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses how Baldur's Gate 3 outshines Starfield as a role-playing game and why it's completely okay if you disagree. Later in the show, Alex breaks down the changes introduced in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 and shares why the battle royale's meta is in a great place. Afterward, Marcus talks about the many ways in which Armored Core VI makes him feel cool.

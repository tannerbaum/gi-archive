  Baldur's Gate 3 Is An Incredible RPG Worth Playing | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, returning guest Kenneth Shepard (Kotaku, Normandy FM) joins us to discuss why Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs of 2023, despite the fact we're still working our way through the massive game. Additionally, Marcus clues the crew in on his time spent solving puzzles in Viewfinder and his preview impressions of Palia, an MMO-like life sim currently in closed beta.

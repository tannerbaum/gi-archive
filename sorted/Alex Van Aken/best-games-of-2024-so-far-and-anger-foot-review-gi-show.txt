  Best Games of 2024 (So Far) And Anger Foot Review | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew attempts to highlight the best games of 2024 that have launched between January and July. This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it's more a conversation about this year's early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives' new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty's Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

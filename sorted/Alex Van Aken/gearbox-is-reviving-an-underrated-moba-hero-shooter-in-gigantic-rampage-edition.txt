  Gearbox Is Reviving An Underrated MOBA-Hero Shooter In Gigantic: Rampage Edition






            Developer Abstraction Games aims to resurrect Gigantic, the 5v5 MOBA-hero-shooter hybrid that went offline in 2018 – only a year after its full release. I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.

Notably, Game Informer's original Gigantic review wasn't as positive as I personally felt about the game. Did you play the original version? If so, what was your opinion? Do you think Gearbox can successfully find an audience this time around?

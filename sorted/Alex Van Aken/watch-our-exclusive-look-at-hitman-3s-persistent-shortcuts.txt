  Watch Our Exclusive Look At Hitman 3's Persistent Shortcuts






            The Hitman series has always encouraged its players to replay missions, so it's no surprise that one of the brand new features coming to Hitman 3 is the persistent shortcuts system. IO Interactive told us these in-game shortcuts can only be unlocked from one direction, but are designed to "encourage exploration, reward curiosity, and incentivize replayability." Once a player has unlocked a persistent shortcut, they can access it in a future playthrough to open up new and convenient ways to access their targets. As you can see in our Hitman 3 gameplay above, this feature will allow you to approach locations from a new direction and shave those precious seconds off of your mission time.

Please note that this Hitman 3 gameplay was captured on PC by Game Informer.

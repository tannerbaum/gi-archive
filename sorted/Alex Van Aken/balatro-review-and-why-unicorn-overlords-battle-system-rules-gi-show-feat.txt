  Balatro Review And Why Unicorn Overlord's Battle System Rules | GI Show (Feat. Eric Van Allen)






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, returning guest Eric Van Allen (Destructoid, Axe of the Blood God) joins us to discuss our Balatro review, spoiler-free thoughts about the length of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the early hours of Penny's Big Breakaway, and finally, how the combat system in Vanillaware's Unicorn Overlord mimics Final Fantasy XII's Gambits (that's a very good thing).

Lastly, we want to highlight our former colleague and close friend, Blake Hester, who was affected by a corporate restructuring from our parent company this week. Blake's original reporting and responsibility as our working features editor have transformed Game Informer over the last three-and-a-half years into an outlet known for thoughtful reporting on games and the people making them. Please go support Blake and follow his work right here.

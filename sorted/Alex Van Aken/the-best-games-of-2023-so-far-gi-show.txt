  The Best Games Of 2023 So Far | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, hosts Alex Van Aken and Marcus Stewart determine the best games of 2023 (their favorites, actually, but "best games" is better SEO) by looking back through Game Informer's 2023 video game release schedule. Obvious picks are The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Resident Evil 4 (Remake), however we also highlight lesser-known standouts like Friends Vs Friends, A Space for the Unbound, and Terra Nil.

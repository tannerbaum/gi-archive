  We're Piledriving Players In Rumbleverse | Game Informer Live






            It's been a long week, and I'm ready to blow some steam off by piledriving teenagers into concrete – in a fictional video game setting, of course! Rumbleverse, the new battle royale wrestling game from the creators of Killer Instinct (2013), releases today for free. In Rumbleverse, you equip wrestling moves and stat-boosting consumables like protein powder instead of guns and weapon attachments.

It seems cool, so I'll play it with former Associate Editor John Carson today!

We're going live at 2:00 p.m. Central on our Twitch page, and then I'll upload it to the Game Informer YouTube channel afterward. See you soon.

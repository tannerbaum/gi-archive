  Most Anticipated Upcoming Game Releases And Everybody 1-2 Switch Review | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew opens our video game release schedule again to look ahead at our most anticipated upcoming game releases. Of course, massive projects like Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3 line our list, but we also hope to highlight lesser-known titles that are promising. Towards the start of the podcast, we also share our early Everybody 1-2 Switch review impressions.

  Making Kimberly's Street Fighter 6 Theme – Inside The Capcom Music Studio






            In this exclusive behind-the-scenes interview, lead composer Yoshiya Terayama gives us an inside look at the making of Ninja Pop Star, newcomer Kimberly's character theme in Street Fighter 6, at Capcom's headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Terayama, member of Capcom's in-house band, shows off the individual instruments that comprise Kimberly's music, the process of revising a track based on work from the larger development team, and why Kimberly's old-school tastes pair well with the game's hip-hop inspirations.

  Xbox & Bethesda Showcase Predictions, Saints Row, and MultiVersus | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew shares their Xbox & Bethesda Showcase predictions and impressions from a recent hands-on session with the Saints Row reboot. During The Playlist, we talk about a cool new mascot brawler called MultiVersus and how it differentiates itself from the Super Smash Bros. formula, our Vampire: The Masquerade Swansong review impressions, and how many hours we've lost to Rogue Legacy 2.

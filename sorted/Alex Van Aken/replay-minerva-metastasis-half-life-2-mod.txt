  Replay – Minerva: Metastasis (Half-Life 2 Mod)






            Join the Game Informer crew as they play the popular Half-Life 2 mod, Minerva: Metastasis. Additionally, the team will be exploring a few interesting survival horror experiences on Steam, like Night of the Consumers, Home, and Last of Ass. Yup, you read that right.

Minerva: Metastasis tasks you with surviving on a remote Combine island while also attempting to unravel the mystery housed deep within. You'll just have to tune in and see what the other games have in store.

Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, Marcus Stewart, and Alex Van Aken as they survive the Combine and delve into more fun horror experiences from the Steam library.

We'll be kicking off the show today at 2:30 p.m. CT, so be sure to join us in the chat and end your week on a high note! If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Exclusive Interview: Koji Fox Breaks Down The Lore Of Final Fantasy XVI






            As part of this month’s cover story, we traveled to Japan to speak with several of Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit III leads. In this exclusive interview, localization director Michael-Christopher Koji Fox breaks down the lore of Final Fantasy XVI, including its world, characters, political strife, and how the narrative frames crystal-use in exciting ways. We hope you enjoy this deep dive into the world of Valisthea.

Editor's note: In the video interview, we incorrectly cited Koji Fox's title as senior translator. His accurate title is localization director.

  Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora Cover Story And Talos Principle 2 | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, Alex and Marcus break down our latest cover story featuring Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and chat about their multiple play sessions thus far. However, prior to our cover story discussion, we call out this week's layoffs at Ubisoft, during which the company laid off over a hundred employees. Later in the show, we chat with Charles about his positive Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 review before diving into a new puzzle game, The Talos Principle 2, and Fortnite OG, the popular battle royale's latest season that's smashing records.

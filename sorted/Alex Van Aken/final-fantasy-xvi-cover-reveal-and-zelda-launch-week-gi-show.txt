  Final Fantasy XVI Cover Reveal And Zelda Launch Week  | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew reveals our next magazine cover story, featuring Final Fantasy XVI, which sent Wesley across the ocean to Square Enix Japan. Afterward, we dive into a 30-minute spoiler-free discussion about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and share our thoughts on the game. Of course, Hyrule wasn't the only world we explored this week, as Lego 2K Drive and Humanity, created in part by Tetris Effect creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi, were released on May 16.

  Loop Hero – New Gameplay Today






            Announced at the Game Awards 2020, Loop Hero is an upcoming deck-builder set within a timeless loop of darkness, complete with roguelite and auto-battler elements. Each loop begins in darkness, with nothing but a brave hero and barren, looping path. As the run progresses, the player utilizes an expanding deck of various cards to place enemy units, buildings and points of interest, and terrain - all of which serve as buffs or hardships that the auto-running hero must overcome. Luckily, you can speed up or slow down time on a whim, or pause the loop if you need a little more time to plan your card placements.

  Saints Row: Exclusive First Look At The World Of Santo Ileso






            The Saints Row reboot is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated games releasing in the early months of 2022, and as part of our month of exclusive coverage, we’re showing off the first look of the world of Santo Ileso. Yep, that means never-before-seen gameplay! This surreal spin on the American Southwest is home to rustic desert neighborhoods, bustling city streets, and neon-lit alleyways – its vibrant locations are explorable by car, motorcycle, wingsuit, and more.

Please note that this Saints Row gameplay is pre-alpha footage supplied by Deep Silver and represents a game still in development.

  Watch 21 Minutes Of Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown Gameplay






            Surprise announced only a few days ago during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown immediately impressed us with its flash platforming gameplay. We got some hands-on in with the game while visiting Los Angeles for the Summer Game Fesst festivities, and we are only more eager for the game's full release after spending 20 minutes with the game.

You can check out about 20 minutes of gameplay footage below, where is should be noted that some progression items were unlocked for the sake of the demo.

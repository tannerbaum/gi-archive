  I Tested 23 Games On Steam Deck To Surprising Results






            I spent 24 hours playing on Valve's new handheld, the Steam Deck, and tested 23 popular games to see how they run out-of-the-box on the portable gaming PC. To my surprise, several unverified titles run great on Steam Deck, while unfortunately, some iconic PC games run poorly. We tested top games like Ark: Survival Evolved, Cyberpunk 2077, DOTA 2, DOOM Eternal, Halo Infinite, Lost Ark, Skyrim Anniversary Edition, Rust, and Valheim.

Check out the video below to see the results:

  Exploring Man's Duality In RoboCop: Rogue City And Jusant | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew explores two extremes: RoboCop: Rogue City — which is somehow the best RoboCop game — and Jusant, the meditative rock-climbing adventure that's developer Don't Nod's best work since the original Life Is Strange. Later in the show, Kyle pantomimes WarioWare: Move It's energetic mechanics before Alex dives into his most recent session of The Finals, which is currently the number one wishlisted game on Steam.

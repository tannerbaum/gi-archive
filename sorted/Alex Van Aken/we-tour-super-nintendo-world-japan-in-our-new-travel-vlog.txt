  We Tour Super Nintendo World Japan In Our New Travel Vlog






            In this special travel vlog, Game Informer's Alex Van Aken and Brian Shea tour Super Nintendo World while visiting Osaka, Japan. The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach's Castle, Bowser's Castle, Toad's Cafe, Yoshi's Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios' rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we've experienced.

Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

  Two Point Campus Review And Nier: Automata Church Mystery | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, returning guest Jesse Vitelli (Prima Games) joins us to discuss our Two Point Campus review, why Ghostrunner is an underrated cyberpunk game, and finally, whatever the heck "Nier Church" is. At the show's end, the crew talks about Stray's ending and why the game about being a cat is oddly poignant. Don't worry – we give plenty of spoiler warnings!

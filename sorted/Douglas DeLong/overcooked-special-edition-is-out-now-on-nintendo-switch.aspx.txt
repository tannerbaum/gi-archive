  Overcooked Special Edition Is Out Now On Nintendo Switch






Overcooked is a frantic and fun multiplayer game that requires you and your friends to make food and save the world, and it's out now on Nintendo Switch.
Overcooked Special Edition allows you to play with up to four friends using individual Joy-Con or Pro Controllers, and includes both of the game's expansions.Â 
To find out why we named Overcooked the best cooperative multiplayer game of last year, you can check out our review and watch us play the game in an episode of Test Chamber.

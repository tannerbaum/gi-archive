A year and a half ago, Retro City Rampage creator Brian Provinciano announced that his new game would be called Shakedown: Hawaii, and today it finally got a full reveal trailer.
Shakedown: Hawaii is another open-world crime game played from an isometric perspective, but instead of playing as a lowly thug, you play as an aging businessman looking to get into white-collar crime. The new trailer shows off the game's silly tone and the business acquisition metagame. Throughout the game you go on missions with classic driving and shooting action, and then return home to acquire new businesses and find ways to increase your profit margins, such as putting drywall in your unregulated testosterone pills. You can check out the trailer below.

To learn more, you can read a detailed post from the creator on the Playstation Blog, and watch some gameplay from last year's PSX. The game is coming to the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, Steam, and will be cross-buy on the Playstation 4 and Vita, with a release planned for sometime later this year.

At this year's San Diego Comic Con, Sega announced that Special Stages would be coming to Sonic Mania, and today we got our first glimpse of the new stages in action.
The new gameplay trailer is a nostalgia trip for longtime fans. It starts by showing Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles running around in a few of the Special Stages, which are reminiscent of the levels in Sonic R. Then we get a brief glimpse at a stage that looks like Studiopolis Act 2 before the trailer transitions into the game's Bonus Stages, which are pulled straight from Sonic 3 & Knuckles. At the end, we get a look at the Time Trial mode and its handy reset button, which allows you to instantly start over as you try to perfect your run.

  Techland Releases A Video Detailing Dying Light's Year Of Free DLC






Last month, Techland announced that it would be creating 10 pieces of free DLC for Dying Light over the next 12 months, and today the studio released a video that gives some more detail on the new offerings.
Over the course of the next year, you can expect "new, challenging enemies, more in-game events, new mysteries to solve, and much, much more." The new content will be available on all available platforms free of charge.

The first content drop, DLC #0, is coming soon.

Our Take:It's nice to see Techland continuing to support its game almost three years after release. We really enjoyed playing Dying Light and its DLC, so these new additions are certainly welcome.

Path of Exile is a free-to-play, Diablo-inspired action RPG that launched back in 2013 and has been growing ever since. This summer, the game is getting its largest expansion yet, and you can play it now on Xbox One. 
The beta for The Fall of Oriath is live now and space is limited, so sign up fast! You can register for a beta key here. Players will be able to explore the expansion's six new acts and try out the new Pantheon character customization system which "provides you with potent powers taken from the gods themselves."

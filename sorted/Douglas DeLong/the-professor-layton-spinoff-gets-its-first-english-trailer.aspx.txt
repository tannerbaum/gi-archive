Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy is a new game that marks the tenth anniversary of the Professor Layton series, and today it got its first English trailer.

The trailer introduces us to the new protagonist, Professor Layton's daughter Katrielle, and her talking-dog sidekick. It looks like the series mind-bending puzzles, beautiful art, and quirky sense of humor will all be present as Katrielle tries to get to the bottom of a whopping conspiracy and find her missing father.

  August's Games With Gold Lineup Includes Bayonetta And Red Faction






Today Microsoft unveiled the Games with Gold lineup for August, and it's a solid bunch of games. 
The headliner is the absurd stylish-action game Bayonetta for Xbox 360, which will be available to download for free from August 1-15. The other 360 game in the bunch is Red Faction: Armageddon, which will be available from August 16-31. Both 360 games are backwards compatible, so you can play them on Xbox One as well. 
Xbox One owners will also be able to download Trials Fusion from August 16-Sept 15. The final game is Slime Rancher, which makes its debut on Xbox on August 1 and remains free through the rest of the month.

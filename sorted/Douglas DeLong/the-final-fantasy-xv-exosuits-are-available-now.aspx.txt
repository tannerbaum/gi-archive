  The Final Fantasy XV Exosuits Are Available Now






Earlier this year, Square Enix delayed a free update that was going to add Magitek Exosuits to Final Fantasy XV because of their striking similarity to Power Rangers. Now, the suits are back, and they've got a new look.
Donning the new costumes makes you invincible for 30 minutes, but you can only put them on once every 24 hours.

Our TakeÂ Is it just me, or do they look like The Collectors from Mass Effect 2?

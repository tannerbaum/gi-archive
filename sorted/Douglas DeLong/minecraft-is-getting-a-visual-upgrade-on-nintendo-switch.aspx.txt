  Minecraft Is Getting A Visual Upgrade On Nintendo Switch






A new patch came out for the Switch version of Minecraft today, and along with a variety of bug fixes there's also a visual upgrade!
Now, Minecraft will display in 1080p when the Switch is in docked mode. Also included in the update are a new track for Mincraft's hang-glider-esque Glide mini-game, and Terracotta and Glazed Terracotta layers in the competitive Tumble mini-game. For the full patch notes, you can head here.
Later this Fall, Microsoft plans to unite all of Minecraft's servers and allow for cross-platform multiplayer. You can read more about those plans here.

Our Take:The Switch is a great place to play Minecraft; it's portable and you don't have to deal with weird tablet controls. It's nice to see that 4J Studios is committed to supporting and improving this version of the game.

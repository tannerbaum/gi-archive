Ever Oasis is a new JRPG from Koichi Ishii, who worked on classics like Final Fantasy and Secret of Mana, and it's coming out very soon. For those still looking to learn more about the game, Nintendo released a trailer that gives an overview of many of the game's systems.
The game begins with you establishing the last oasis in a vast desert, and over the course of the game you build it into a vibrant town with many residents and booths. When you aren't managing your oasis, you're in dungeons, battling fierce beasts with a party of residents at your side.

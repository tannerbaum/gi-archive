The Game Boy Advance classic, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga is being remade for the 3DS 14 years after its original release. This new edition comes with a variety of updates, the most noticeable being the art style, which has been adopted from the more recent entries in the series. 

The more substantial addition is the new Minion Quest mode, which tells a story that runs parallel to that of Mario and Luigi. Through these events, we'll finally be able to learn what happened to Bowser's minions after the Koopa Cruiser crashed.

In this new story, you play as Captain Goomba, and the battle mode is entirely different. Before fights, you customize your party by choosing which units you'd like to have and where to position them on the battlefield. Then combat plays out in real time and it's up to you to use captain commands and special abilities to control the flow of battle. As you progress, you'll level up your party, acquire new captains, and expand your army of units.

The base game is a hilarious classic, and this substantial new campaign looks like a nice treat that has the same humor and strategic depth. Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions is releasing on October 6.

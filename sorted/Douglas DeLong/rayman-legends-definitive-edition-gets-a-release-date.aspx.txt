  Rayman Legends Definitive Edition Gets A Release Date






Following the Nintendo Switch presentation back in January, Ubisoft announced that they were working on porting Rayman Legends to the Nintendo Switch. Today, Ubisoft announced that the game will be launching very soon; Rayman Legends Definitive Edition releases on September 12. 
The Definitive Edition takes full advantage of the Switch's capabilities. You can play with up to four players via a local internet connection, and if you're playing in the undocked mode, you can take advantage of the touchscreen functionality that was present in the Wii U version. Ubisoft says there are some brand new features in store as well, like an updated version of the soccer minigame Kung Foot.

Our Take:Somehow I own two versions of this game but still haven't played it. The third time's a charm I guess; I'm really excited to play this on the Switch!

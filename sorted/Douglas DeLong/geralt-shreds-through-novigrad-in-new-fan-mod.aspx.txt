  Geralt Shreds Through Novigrad In New Fan Mod






The world of the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is massive, and it takes a while to traverse by normal means of transportation. CD Projekt RED incorporated a fast travel system to ameliorate long journeys, but sometimes you just really don't want to sit and watch a load screen. Thankfully, modder Eutirion is here to save the day with one of the more creative solutions I've seen.
Geralt of Rivia's Pro Witcher 3 adds in a number of tweaks to get around on land and in the water faster, but the highlight is a new sliding mechanic that allows Geralt to jump in the air and start grinding through the world faster than the textures can load. You can check out a video of him catching some big air with his new invisible Heelys here. If you're interested in taking the new Geralt for a spin yourself, you can download the mod here.

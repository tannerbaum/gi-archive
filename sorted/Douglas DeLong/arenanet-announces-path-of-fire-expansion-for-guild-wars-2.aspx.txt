  ArenaNet Announces Path Of Fire Expansion For Guild Wars 2






In a livestream broadcast today, ArenaNet announced Path of Fire, the second expansion for Guild Wars 2. 
Balthazar, the god of fire and war, has gone rogue and is setting out on a campaign against the Elder Dragons. In your quest to defeat him, you'll travel to the Crystal Desert and the adjoining kingdom of Elona.
Traveling around these large locations will be made easier with the new mounts that you can unlock and train, such as the Raptor pictured above. The expansion also includes nine more elite specializations to further customize your level 80 character. 
Pre-purchasing the expansion will net you a few bonus items, and if you haven't picked up the first expansion, Heart of Thorns, yet, buying both together will save you some money.
You can check out the trailer below.

For more details on the new additions, you can head to the official website or watch the full announcement video. A preview weekend will take place from August 11-13, and the full expansion is set to launch on September 22. 

Our Take:Since its launch in 2012, Guild Wars 2 has become free-to-play. If you've ever been curious to see what the game is all about, it seems like now is a good time to jump in.

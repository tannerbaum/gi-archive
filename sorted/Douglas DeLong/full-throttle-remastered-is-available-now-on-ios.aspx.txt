  Full Throttle Remastered Is Available Now On iOS






Full Throttle Remastered released earlier this year on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC, and now it's available on iOS for just $4.99. 
Full Throttle is a classic LucasArts adventure game from 1995 that creator Tim Schafer and Double Fine just gave a fresh coat of paint. In our review, we said "The quirks of the original game are as attractive today as they were then, and this version does a fine job smoothing out the rough edges, making Full Throttle Remastered a road trip worth taking." 
To celebrate the iOS release, Double Fine put out a new cinematic trailer that you can view below.

  .hack//G.U. Last Recode Gets Physical Release On PlayStation 4






When we wrote up a list of PS2 RPG HD Collections we'd like to seeÂ back in 2014, we mentioned that we'd be excited if the .hack//G.U. trilogy got remastered. Now it's actually happening. Today Bandai Namco announced .hack//G.U. Last Recode is getting a physical release on PlayStation 4.
The .hack//G.U. Last Recode collection includes Rebirth, Reminisce, and Redemption. Each version comes with 1080p visuals, 16:9 widescreen format, and 60 frames per second. The trilogy also includes gameplay balance changes and additional features that will be announced at a later date. Look for the title later this year on PS4 and Steam.

Our Take:It's shaping up to be a good year for PS2 RPG fans. Final Fantasy XII was also on that list, and it got a great remaster just a couple weeks ago. Coincidence? I think not!

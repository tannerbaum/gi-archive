  The Insane World Of Bloodborne Seeps Into Dark Souls In New Fan Mod






The worlds of Bloodborne and Dark Souls have unique and fascinating art direction, but what would happen if you mixed them together? Yesterday, a modder who goes by Abject gave us the answer: it looks pretty cool!
BloodSouls is a new Dark Souls mod that adds the Saw Cleaver, Blunderbuss, and a Bloodborne shield to the game. Also included are some reskins of the HUD and Icons.

You can download BloodSouls here to make your Chosen Undead into a Hunter. If you're looking for other ways to get your Bloodborne fix, check out our impressions of Bloodborne: The Card Game.

  From Narbacular Drop To Portal






In 2005, a team of seven Digipen students put together an innovative
puzzle game called Narbacular Drop for their senior project. In the two
years that followed, the entire team was recruited by legendary
developer Valve to turn their class project into the immediately
beloved Portal. Check out the video below to hear three members of the
Narbacular Drop team talk about the immediate transition from working
on schoolwork to working on a high-profile, massively successful title.

  Valve Studio Tour: From Old To New






Over the last decade, Valve's reputation and sales numbers have
grown by leaps and bounds. Franchises like Left 4 Dead and Portal have been
introduced to fantastic critical and commercial reaction, resulting in
the company as a whole growing in size. As such, they started to
outgrow their 38,000 sq. ft. studio in Bellevue, Washington. This
month, the entire studio packed up and moved down the road a bit to a
brand-new location that will be almost three times as big when it's all
said and done.Check out our video below to see the old studio pre-move, the new studio under construction, and finally, the finished product.

  October Cover Revealed – Call Of Duty: Ghosts






Year in and year out, Call of Duty sets sales records with its blockbuster-like campaigns and engaging multiplayer. Whether it's been Infinity Ward or Treyarch at the helm, the last several years have seen the series avoid the franchise fatigue that plagued other Activision franchises like Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero. With Call of Duty: Ghosts, Infinity Ward is branching out into a completely new universe as the series lands on next-gen.
Our October issue dives deep into the upcoming juggernaut, with plenty of hands-on details and impressions from both campaign and multiplayer, including an exclusive look at the single-player mission Struck Down and much more. You'll learn about what caused the worldwide conflict in the Ghosts universe, be introduced to the squad themselves, and read about the improvements that are made possible by next-gen tech.
You'll have to wait a couple of months for its November 5 release, but we aim to make the wait more tolerable with a month's worth of exclusive features. Executive producer Mark Rubin sat down with us for a lengthy interview, and our series of video features covers his experience of creating a new universe for the blockbuster franchise. For a taste of what's to come, check out our coverage trailer below.

  Replay – Star Wars Masters Of Teras Kasi






The demographic crossover between video game fans and Star Wars fans is an unsurprising one. However, the gaming interpretations of the galaxy far, far away have suffered from a very spotty history. For every Knights of the Old Republic or Rogue Squadron, there's a Super Bombad Racing or Jedi Power Battles. Despite some who may have enjoyed 1997's Star Wars fighter, Masters of Teras Kasi falls into the latter group for most gamers. Check out our newest edition of Replay below to hear myself, Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, and Joe Juba play and reminisce over a game that most of us didn't necessarily have the fondest memories of.

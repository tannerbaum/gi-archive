  Replay â€“ Turok






We always check our comments to see what games you'd like to see
featured in Replay, and this week's selection is one that's been
requested many times. Turok: Dinosaur Hunter was released on February
28th of 1997, and was met with critical and commercial success. At this
early point in the Nintendo 64's life, games were scarce and shooters
even moreso. The 64-bit FPS crown was handed over to Goldeneye later
that year, but many gamers still have fond memories of raptor murder
and awkward platforming. Take a look at the newest edition of Replay
below to see how Turok has stood the test of time.

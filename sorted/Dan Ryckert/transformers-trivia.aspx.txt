  Transformers Trivia: GI Vs War For Cybertron Developer






While visiting High Moon Studios' offices in San Diego, we were introduced to cinematics director Dave Cravens. Even if we hadn't been introduced, we definitely would have noticed one particular office that was covered wall-to-wall with Transformers toys and memorabilia. Since he was a kid, Cravens has soaked up all the Transformers trivia and merchandise that he possibly can, and has an extensive knowledge base of the fiction to go along with it. Considering that we work in an office full of gaming nerds here at Game Informer, it should come as no surprise that a couple of our editors know a thing or two about the robots in disguise. We found it only appropriate to have ourselves a friendly face-off with the master of Transformers trivia.

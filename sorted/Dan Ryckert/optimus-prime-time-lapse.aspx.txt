  Optimus Primed: A Time Lapse Look At An Autobot's Creation






The developers behind Transformers: War For Cybertron have an interesting task when it comes to their game's creation. Fans of the cartoon have a very specific view of how the robots in disguise look, but various iterations throughout the years have tweaked their image substantially. Many were irked by the Micheal Bay-ified insect-like versions of the Autobots and Decepticons in the recent live action films, as they strayed too far from the G1 originals. High Moon Studios is approaching this task by putting a modern polish on a look that still brings back memories of the cartoon that launched the series into pop culture history.

Take a look below at Senior Concept Artist Billy King as he details the most iconic of the Transformers - Optimus Prime.

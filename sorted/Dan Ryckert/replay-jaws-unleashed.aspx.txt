  Replay â€“ Jaws Unleashed






This week is a bit of a departure from our first two episodes of Replay. Whereas the previous editions featured well-received titles from the PSone era, we'll be looking at a game today that's a lot more recent and a lot less good: Jaws Unleashed. For those of you who played it, you'll remember it as a deeply flawed but oftentimes hilarious title that puts you in the shoes (fins?) of Peter Benchley's terrifying creation. Jaws Unleashed asked gamers to eat bungee jumpers, water skiers, and pretty much anyone unfortunate enough to be visiting Amity Island. Check out the video below to see me, Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, and Phil Kollar terrorize the seas, and stick around for our Replay Roulette bonus game.

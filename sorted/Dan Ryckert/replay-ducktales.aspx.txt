  Replay – DuckTales






We've been getting a lot of requests in the comment sections of Replay, and many of you mentioned that you'd like to see some NES titles. We figure most gamers have a pretty clear memory of the obvious choices (Mario, Zelda, Punch-Out) thanks to re-releases, emulators, and the Virtual Console, so we landed on Scrooge McDuck's treasure-hunting adventures. It was well-received when it was released and many gamers have feelings of nostalgia for it, but how does the gameplay hold up two decades later? Check out the new episode below and just try to get the cartoon's theme out of your head.

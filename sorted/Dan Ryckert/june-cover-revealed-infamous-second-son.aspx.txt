  June Cover Revealed: Infamous Second Son






This holiday will mark the release of the PlayStation 4, and gamers can't wait to learn more about Sony's jump to the next generation. In anticipation of this big event, Game Informer set out to create the definitive PlayStation 4 issue. Starting with a 10 page feature on Sucker Punch's Infamous Second Son (the cover star), our massive feature doesn't stop there. We explore the future of PlayStation 4 including Sony's new indie agenda, discuss Media Molecule's upcoming project, and reveal new information and screens for Destiny, Knack, Killzone: Shadow Fall, and DriveClub. On top of all that, we also interviewed Sony's Shuhei Yoshida and got our hands on the Dual Shock 4 controller. 
But enough about our 30-page PlayStation 4 cover story, let's get back to Infamous Second Son.
With Cole MacGrath out of the picture, the country is on high alert looking for other conduits. To deal with this perceived threat, the government has set up the oppressive Department of Unified Protection, and they've placed Seattle on lockdown. As new protagonist Delsin Rowe, players will be given more than enough opportunities to fight the power.
Watch our coverage trailer below for a taste of what to expect from our content. Also, check out the first information on three new PlayStation indie games: Hohokum, a creative and colorful 2D sandbox game; Counterspy, a 2D cover-based shooter steeped in the spy mythology of the '50s and '60s; and Doki-Doki Universe, a quirky tale from the creator of ToeJam & Earl starring a robot on a mission to learn about humanity.

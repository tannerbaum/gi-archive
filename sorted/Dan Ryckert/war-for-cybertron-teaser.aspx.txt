  First Teaser Trailer For Transformers: War For Cybertron Released






Transformers fans should definitely keep a keen eye on War For Cybertron, as it's a new title that isn't based on either of the recent Bay-tastic blockbusters. Take a look at the brief trailer below, it doesn't show any gameplay but it has a rather sweet shot of Optimus Prime batting a missile out of the air. No official release date has been announced, but keep an eye on our Transformers: War For Cybertron hub in the coming month for plenty of exclusive info.

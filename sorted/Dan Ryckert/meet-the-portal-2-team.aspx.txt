  Meet The Portal 2 Team






Earlier this month, we introduced you to the Digipen students who were hired by Valve to turn their class project Narbacular Drop into the instant classic Portal. During our visit, we also had a chance to meet with other members of the Portal 2 team, amongst whom are several Valve veterans. Take a look at the video below to learn more about the team that puts together the mind-bending puzzles and hilarious GLaDOS dialogue that made Portal such a phenomenon.

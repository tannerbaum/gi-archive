  Submit Your Questions For Our Metal Gear Solid V Podcast






If you're anything like us, you've got a million questions about where the story of Metal Gear Solid is going in Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. We don't know all the answers, but we've beaten Ground Zeroes and have spent plenty of time theorizing about where the story is going. Now's your chance to ask us about what's on your mind.
In the comments below, we want you to get as nerdy and in-depth with your Metal Gear Solid V questions. We'll be assembling a panel of GI's biggest fans of the franchise and answering your questions in a podcast later this week.
Keep up with our month of ongoing Metal Gear Solid V stories and videos by bookmarking the hub link below.

  Replay – Bushido Blade






Our first edition of Replay resulted in numerous requests for games we
should revisit, and our pick for this week is one that many of you
mentioned. The original Bushido Blade for the PSone was a fighter
unlike any other, featuring an entirely original approach to the genre.
Bouts could end with one well-placed blow, and players were free to
roam around its vast, oftentimes-destructible stages. Take a look below
for our Replay of Bushido Blade. Make sure to stick around afterward
for our first installment of Replay Roulette, in which we pull a random
game off the Vault shelf and pop it in for a few minutes.

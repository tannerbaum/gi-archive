  October Cover Revealed: New Super Mario Bros. U






Gaming's most famous face has graced our cover on a few occasions, but it's been 16 years since our cover story has focused on one of his adventures. We recently had the chance to visit Nintendo of America to play New Super Mario Bros. U, but that's not all we did at the studio. In addition to our ten-page Mario cover story (featuring an interview with legendary designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka), we also have an extensive feature that will prepare you for the impending launch of the Wii U.

We'll also have plenty of non-Nintendo news, including features on Halo 4's Prometheans and the first three hours of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. To kick off the holiday review season, you can also read our thoughts on one of the year's biggest releases, Borderlands 2. Can Gearbox's massive sequel live up to the original? Find out in our October issue, which should be hitting print subscribers near September 10th and digital PC/Mac subscribers on September 11th.
The 10" tablet edition will go live later today, so download the free app for iPad and Android now. To subscribe to Game Informer Digital or convert your current print subscription through us head here. Getting your GI Digital Subscription through us gives you access to the 10" Android, iPad, and PC/Mac editions of the magazine.

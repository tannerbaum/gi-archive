  Replay â€“ Twisted Metal 1-4






Most everyone that played Twisted Metal 1 and 2 back in the day has fond memories of them. Their cartoonish brand of mayhem and sick sense of humor resulted in great sales numbers and an enthusiastic fanbase, before 989 Studios took over and tarnished the series' good name. It may have experienced a great rebirth via Twisted Metal: Black on the PS2, but the original Playstation titles by Singletrac laid the groundwork for all subsequent car combat titles (a genre that's been sorely underrepresented in recent years).

In this new segment we utilize our extensive vault to play through each PSone Twisted Metal title in order, and even try out the vehicular combat experiments Singletrac developed after losing the franchise name. Do the original classics hold up over a decade later? Are 3 and 4 as bad as we remember them being? Does Tim Turi fail miserably in his attempt to blow up the Eiffel Tower? The answer to the last question is yes. Check out the video below to relive the 32-bit vehicular combat experience.

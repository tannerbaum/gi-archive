  Hip-Hop Tribute Album To Chrono Trigger Now Available






Gato, the rapping robot you encounter in the opening moments of Chrono Trigger, could learn a thing or two from producer K-Murdock, who has brought together a talented group of friends to make Hero Muzik Vol. II, a tribute to Chrono Trigger's memorable cast of characters and soundtrack.
The album features 12 artists from the Nerdy People of Color Collective, including Mega Ran and Sammus, who each memorialize their favorite Chrono Trigger characters in verse, set to K-Murdock's remixes of Yasunori Mitsuda's original score.
Hero Muzik Vol. II is available on Bandcamp for $8.
You can listen to a sampler of the album below.

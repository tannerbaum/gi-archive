After finishing up his role in the Allies' North African Campaign in Tunisia, Lt. Karl Fairburne heads to nearby Sicily to begin the story of Sniper Elite 4.
A new story trailer released today provides some context. Sicily was a strategically crucial launch point for the Allies' Italian Campaign, which sought to unseat dictator and German ally Benito Mussolini. By linking up with Italian anti-Mussolini fighters in Sicily, Fairburne's job will be to help sow seeds of rebellion and prepare the way for the southern Allied invasion of mainland Europe.
You can watch the full story trailer below.

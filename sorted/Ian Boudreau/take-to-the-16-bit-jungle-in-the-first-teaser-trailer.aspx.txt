The sequel to 2012's Retro City Rampage is Shakedown: Hawaii, and there's a shiny new teaser trailer for it just in time for PSX.
Retro City Rampage was a labor of love for indie developer Brian Provinciano, and the same appears true for his latest project. Shakedown: Hawaii looks like it features similar homage-heavy gameplay to the first game, with an updated look and some Metal Gear and Magnum, P.I. references thrown in for good measure. In fact, even this piece of promotional art may look familiar to longtime Game Informer fans...
If you dig the old-school art style, wait until you see it in action in the trailer below.

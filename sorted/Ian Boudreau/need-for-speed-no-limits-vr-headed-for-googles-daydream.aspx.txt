  Need For Speed No Limits VR Headed For Google's Daydream






EA's mobile racer Need for Speed No Limits will be available in VR on Daydream this holiday season.
Need for Speed No Limits VR was announced as part of the early lineup for Google's Daydream headset, which is designed to work with Google's Pixel and Pixel XL handsets. In addition to the VR experience, the game includes 30 licensed exotic cars, 60 events in five event types, 12 tracks set in four environments, and global leaderboard competition via Google Play.
EA did not specify a date beyond "this holiday season," and said only that Need for Speed No Limits VR will be a premium (paid) app.

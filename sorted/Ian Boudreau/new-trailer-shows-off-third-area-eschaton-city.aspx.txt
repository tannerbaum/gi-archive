The second official trailer for Sundered shows off the game's third area, called Eschaton City.
Part of Sundered's core concept is the notion of corruption, and the trailer provides a glimpse at how corruption will work with Eshe's unlockable abilities.
Thunder Lotus creative director William Dubé explains some of the design decisions behind Sundered in a post published today on the PlayStation blog. In it, he discusses why the team decided to go with procedural dungeon generation, and how character progression will work.
Check out the full "Embrace" trailer below. You can see the announcement trailer here.
Sundered is scheduled for release in 2017 on PlayStation 4, PC, Mac, and Linux.

  You Can Try Out Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare For Free This Weekend






If you have yet to play Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, you can try both the campaign and multiplayer modes for free this coming week.
Activision announced they'll be holding a free trial of the game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners starting Thursday, December 15 and running through Tuesday, December 20. Players can try out the first two levels of the campaign, "Rising Threat" and "Black Sky," and jump into multiplayer (with a level 15 cap) and the zombies mode (with a level 3 cap). PC players are, unfortunately, out of luck this time around.
Any progression you make during the free trial will carry over if you decide to purchase the full game.

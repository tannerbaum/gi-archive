Civilization VI


  Launch Trailer Charts The History Of Human Achievement




A new Civilization VI trailer has been released, just ahead of the game's Oct. 21 launch date.
The trailer features a man and woman who begin on a ship near ancient Corsica and trek their way through recorded history, from lighting the lamp held by the Colossus of Rhodes to the first manned space flight and beyond.
"It is the nature of humankind to push itself toward the horizon," the narrator says. "We test our limits, we face our fears, we rise to the challenge and become something greater than ourselves – a civilization."
Check out the trailer below.

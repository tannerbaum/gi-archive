  Miyamoto Suggests He May Devote More Time To Star Fox And Pikmin






Speaking to journalist and host Katie Linendoll for her web series KatieShow, Nintendo's legendary Shigeru Miyamoto said he wished Fox McCloud and Pikmin were bigger hits.
"I always wanted Fox McCloud to be a bit more popular than he is," Miyamoto said through his translator. "But I think one more would be Pikmin."
This echoes sentiments Miyamoto shared with Game Informer this year at E3, when he said he felt that the tepidly-reviewed Star Fox Zero is still a game worth playing.
Miyamoto said he thinks he'll have to put "more energy" into these characters in the future.

Our TakeEven though Star Fox Zero didn't exactly set the world on fire, it'll be reassuring for fans to know that Miyamoto still cares a lot about the series and its characters.

  Elder Scrolls Online New Life Festival Kicks Off Today






The Elder Scrolls Online is marking the holidays with a special event called the New Life Festival, which begins this morning and runs through January 4.
To participate, find the character Breda outside of Windhelm. She'll give you a quest called "The New Life Festival." Once that's done, you'll be able to complete up to nine daily holiday quests, one for each of Tamriel's races. Each quest will reward you with a New Life gift box, which each contain a random crafting material, a consumable New Life memento, a skinchanger style item, and one of a selection of special New Life items.
New holiday-themed items will be available for purchase in the Crown Store throughout the event.
For the full details, check out the announcement on the official site.

Our TakeTis the season for special events! Some of Tamriel's holiday activities sound kind of dangerous, though. I could probably handle the Snow Bear Plunge, but no way am I doing the Lava Foot Stomp.

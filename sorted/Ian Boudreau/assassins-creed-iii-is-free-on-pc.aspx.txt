  Assassin's Creed III Is Free On PC






Starting today for a limited time, Ubisoft is giving away the PC version of Assassin's Creed III free of charge through its Uplay service.
The giveaway is part of Ubisoft's 30th anniversary celebration, which kicked off in June with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Assassin's Creed III replaces last month's free game, Far Cry: Blood Dragon. To get a copy, you just have to sign into Uplay, or create a free account.
Matt Miller awarded Assassin's Creed III a 9.5 when he reviewed it in 2012, calling it "the largest and best Assassin's Creed game" to date.

EA and BioWare released a briefing video today that provides a few details about Mass Effect: Andromeda's intergalactic colony ships and the game's new version of The Citadel, known as the Nexus.
Arks, including Ark Hyperion, are the ships that each carry 20,000 citizens across the 2.5 million light years between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies over the course of several centuries. Once they've arrived, they'll assemble the Nexus, which the video describes as a streamlined version of the Milky Way's Citadel station. The Nexus will function as a center of government and diplomacy, a living area, as well as a base of operations for the Pathfinders, who act as pioneers for new homeworlds.
Check out the full video here. The gameplay trailer revealed at last night's Game Awards ceremony can be found here.

  Full Throttle Remaster Now Has A Trailer






Double Fine's remaster of Full Throttle, which Tim Schafer announced at last year's PlayStation Experience, now has a trailer.
The 1995 LucasArts adventure game stars a motorcycle gang leader named Ben who has to clear his name for a murder he didn't commit. The cast of cartoon outlaws includes Mark Hamill as the nefarious Adrian Ripburger, and the game's grungy soundtrack was performed by The Gone Jackals.
According to the trailer, Full Throttle Remastered will be out sometime in 2017. You can watch it below.

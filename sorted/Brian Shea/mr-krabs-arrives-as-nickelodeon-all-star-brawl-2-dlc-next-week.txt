  Mr. Krabs Arrives As Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 DLC Next Week






            Developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs announced today that Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob SquarePants will join the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 roster next week. The Bikini Bottom resident joins his neighbors SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mecha Plankton, who were all part of the platform fighter's launch roster.

Mr. Krabs arrives on February 15 as the first character included in the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 Season Pass. That pass costs $25 and grants you access to four additional characters – Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob SquarePants, Zuko and Iroh from Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Rocksteady from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – throughout 2024, as well as "The Quickster" outfit for SpongeBob.

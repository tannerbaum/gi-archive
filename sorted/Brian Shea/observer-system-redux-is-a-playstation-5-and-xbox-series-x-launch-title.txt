  Observer: System Redux Is A PlayStation 5 And Xbox Series X Launch Title






            Bloober Team has announced that Observer: System Redux will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on day one. This updated version of the acclaimed cyberpunk thriller adds new content, including three new major missions, updated character models, and new locations.

Additionally, the next-gen hardware enables 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models, and effects. The visuals also now benefit from ray-tracing and HDR lighting. The game will cost $30, a priority for Bloober Team. "We know next-gen pricing is a major concern for our fans and we feel that releasing all the new content and upgrades in Observer: System Redux at the same cost as the original Observer is a great way to stay close with our community," CEO Piotr Babineo said in a press release.

We liked Observer when it launched in 2017, giving it a 9 out of 10 in our review, saying, "Observer is simply the best of both worlds and is a must-play for anyone who considers themselves a fan of either sci-fi or horror."

Observer: System Redux hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on November 10, then PlayStation 5 on November 12.

  Wii U Games That Should Come To Switch In 2022 | All Things Nintendo






            On this first 2022 episode of All Things Nintendo, we dive into the Wii U wasteland to see what we can possibly still salvage. With 2022 on the horizon, Brian invites former Game Informer editor and current MinnMax co-host and GameMill Entertainment marketer Kyle Hilliard on the show to chat about the biggest Wii U games that still haven't made the jump to Switch.

  Animal Crossing: New Horizons 2.0 And Happy Home Paradise Impressions | All Things Nintendo






            This week on All Things Nintendo, we're diving deep into our impressions of the new Animal Crossing: New Horizons 2.0 free update and Happy Home Paradise paid expansion. Host Brian Shea is joined by Game Informer production director Margaret Andrews to chat about their early impressions of the new additions to the wildly popular game. Unfortunately, this episode was recorded earlier in the week than usual, so we skipped the news portion of the show.

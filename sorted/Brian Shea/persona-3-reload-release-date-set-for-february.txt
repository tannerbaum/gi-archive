  Persona 3 Reload Release Date Set For February






            When it was announced in June, Persona 3 Reload finally answered the call that so many fans of the series had been putting out into the world. Following the disappointing release that was Persona 3 Portable on modern consoles earlier this year, Persona 3 Reload appears to be much more in line with what fans were clamoring for when asking for a modern version of the Persona franchise's turning point.

The game is built from the ground up using Unreal Engine, offering a completely modernized take on the classic entry that first arrived in the West in 2007. Persona 3 originally served as the entry that introduced various mechanics that would go on to become series mainstays in subsequent entries, including the popular Social Links. Without Persona 3, more modern games like Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal would likely be very different. 

When the original Persona 3 arrived on PlayStation 2 (known as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3), Game Informer awarded it an 8.5 out of 10. The subsequent releases, Persona 3: FES and Persona 3 Portable on PlayStation 2 and PSP, respectively, each received 8.25 out of 10s when they originally launched. Persona 3 Reload arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 2, 2024. For more on Persona 3 Reload, check out our hands-on preview right here.

  New Gameplay Today – Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu & Eevee






            We may still have a while to wait for an all-new Pokémon game to hit Switch, but in the meantime, you can revisit the early days of the series with Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee. These games are remakes of the first generation of Pokémon (specifically Yellow), but make several modernizations and take a few liberties.

Join us as we explain how Pokémon Go integration works in these games and take a stroll through Go Park, Pallet Town, and Viridian City. We also show off the drop-in co-op play in a battle against an Elite Four member. The episode culminates with a climactic (?) showdown with an overpowered Mewtwo.

Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee is out now for Switch. You can check out our review here.

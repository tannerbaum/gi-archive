  Looking Back At Banjo-Kazooie | All Things Nintendo






            It's a slow week in the world of Nintendo, so we're taking the opportunity to stop and smell the honeycombs. This episode, we're using Banjo-Kazooie coming to the Switch Online Expansion Pack as our excuse to talk about everyone's favorite 64-bit bear-and-bird adventure. Joining Brian this week is Game Informer web designer and programmer Kristin Williams!

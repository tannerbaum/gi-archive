  Ubisoft Not Raising Price On 2020 Next-Gen Games






            Earlier this month, pre-order listings for next-gen SKUs of NBA 2K21 hinted at a $10 price hike to $69.99 when PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X launch later this year. However, during Ubisoft's Q1 earnings call today, the publisher said it does not plan to raise prices this holiday season.

When the topic of Take-Two's price jump for NBA 2K21 was brought up, Ubisoft CFO Frédérick Duguet would only comment on the remainder of 2020. "For the Christmas games, we plan to come with the same price than previous generation of consoles, and that's what we're focused on at the moment," he said. 

Later in the call, Duguet expressed excitement for the launch of the new consoles and the promising manufacturing reports. "It is, each time, putting a boost on the industry, and the fact that they are able to create the number of machines they want to create is a very positive element for the industry," he said in the call. "We are going to be there, ready with lots of great games for the launch of those consoles, so we are very excited by that."

The remainder of Ubisoft's 2020 includes Watch Dogs: Legion on October 29 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla on November 17. Ubisoft's first major release of 2021 is currently Far Cry 6, which launches on February 18. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are both slated to launch this holiday season.

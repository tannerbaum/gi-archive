  The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 25th Anniversary | All Things Nintendo






            This week on All Things Nintendo, the episode is devoted to celebrating the anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Not only is it one of the most important and influential video games ever made, but it happens to be in both Brian and Kyle's top two games of all time. It's safe to say there is plenty of love for Ocarina of Time in this episode. We also briefly touch on the release of the game's 3DS remake, as well as the anniversaries of The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds and Super Mario 3D World.

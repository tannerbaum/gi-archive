  Several Xbox One First-Party Favorites Announced For Xbox Series X Optimization






            During the roll out of Xbox Series X information, the team at Xbox has been adamant that compatibility is one of the core features of its vision for the future. While all Xbox One titles are set to work on Xbox Series X, certain titles from Xbox Game Studios developers are being optimized for Xbox Series X, ensuring the new console is the best place to play these already well-liked games. Today, Xbox confirmed Xbox Series X optimizations for Forza Horizon 4, Gears 5, Gears Tactics, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and Sea of Thieves.

These upgraded versions, like all Xbox Game Studios titles, will be available through Xbox Game Pass and Smart Delivery. This means that whether you subscribe to Xbox's popular service or you already own these titles on Xbox One, you'll get the best version automatically for Series X when it's available. 

For Forza Horizon 4, players will be able to speed through Britain in native 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with dramatically improved load times and full leveraging of the Xbox Series X's Quick Resume feature, which lets you hop back into the driver seat right where you left off. Gears 5 will also deliver 4K HDR visuals, reduced load times, and instant resume, while Gears Tactics, which will hit consoles for the first time later this year, will deliver 4K resolution at 60 frames per second on Series X.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Moon Studios' gorgeous action/platformer, is going to achieve 120 frames per second in 4K HDR and 120hz for smooth, low-latency gameplay that could take this precise platformer to the next level. Additionally, Xbox is also launching an optimized version of Sea of Thieves alongside Xbox Series X, though no exact details were given about this optimized version other than it takes advantage of the advanced hardware.

The optimized versions of these games for Xbox Series X are all due this holiday season. Xbox Series X is also set to launch by the end of this year. For more on our coverage of these titles, check out their hubs below.

  Nintendo's Post-Tears Of The Kingdom 2023 | All Things Nintendo






            This episode of All Things Nintendo asks a simple yet important question: Now that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for a couple of weeks, what does the rest of 2023 look like for Switch owners? Marcus Stewart joins Brian to run down what we know so far. But first, the two catch up on the news from the last week.

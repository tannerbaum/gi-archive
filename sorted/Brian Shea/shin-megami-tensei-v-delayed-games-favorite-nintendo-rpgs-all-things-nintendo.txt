  Shin Megami Tensei V, Delayed Games, Favorite Nintendo RPGs | All Things Nintendo






            This week's episode of All Things Nintendo is coming out on time. However, many of the games we discuss will not be doing the same. While this week's big topic is Shin Megami Tensei V (out next week), the theme in our quick-hit news segment is pretty obvious: game delays. Host Brian Shea is joined by Game Informer features editor Kimberley Wallace to talk about all the delays and to chat about what this newest entry to the SMT series brings to the table.

  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Wave 5 DLC Includes Brand New Course, Three Returning Characters






            Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is speeding closer to the end of its six waves of Booster Course Pass DLC, which is said to wrap up before the end of this year. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.

Booster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash;Â Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.

Wave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.

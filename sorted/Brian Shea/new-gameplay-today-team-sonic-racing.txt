  New Gameplay Today â€“ Team Sonic Racing






            Team Sonic Racing is Sega's latest attempt to make its mark on the kart racing genre popularized by the Mario Kart franchise. While past games like Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed have done well, developer Sumo Digital changed things up for this version. Team Sonic Racing focuses the roster solely on characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog universe and implements a unique team-based system that rewards teamwork and scores you based on how your squad of three racers does.

Join Leo Vader, Suriel Vazquez, and me as we play through a few events in Team Sonic Racing. We also take a peek at the customization options and learn why Sonic needs a car to race when he's already so fast.

Team Sonic Racing hits PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 21. Stay tuned over the next few days for our full review.

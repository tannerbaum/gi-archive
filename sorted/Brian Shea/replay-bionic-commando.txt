  Replay – Bionic Commando






            What were you doing in 2009? If you're Capcom, you were re-imagining your classic franchises! Between Street Fighter IV's successful back-to-basics approach and Resident Evil 5's focus on cooperative shooting, Capcom was in the mood for changing things up with its long-running series. Bionic Commando wasn't as iconic as those two juggernaut series, but that didn't stop Capcom from trying to thrust it into the limelight with a dark and gritty 2009 reboot.

No longer was Bionic Commando a 2D sidescroller; now the game was a 3D action game with third-person shooting, a story full of wild twists, and the biggest departure from the original game: the ability to jump. Join us as we experience the opening hour of Bionic Commando on Xbox 360 to learn why this reboot never inspired a sequel.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Battle Crush Coming To Switch, Beta Announced For October






            NCSoft has announced that Battle Crush, its upcoming battle royale brawler, is coming to Nintendo Switch in addition to the previously known PC and mobile release. On top of that, the company revealed that all versions will receive a closed beta test next month, complete with crossplay.

In Battle Crush, players choose a character and fight to be the strongest of a pool of 30 players as the ground collapses around them. Due to ever-encroaching waves of enemies and unique battle arenas, players must be thoughtful with their placement and strategies. The player characters, called Calixers, cover a wide range of influences, often drawing inspiration from mythological figures. Battle royale may be the main mode, but Battle Crush also offers Brawl mode, where a player chooses three Calixers to fight with on a smaller map, and Build-Up, a one-on-one mode where two players compete for a best-of-five series.

Players can sign up for Battle Crush's closed beta test, which is slated to run from October 23 through October 30 on Switch, PC, and Android. Battle Crush is currently planned to launch in spring 2024.

  Square Enix Devotes Division To Developing Switch Games






            Square Enix is readying Octopath Traveler for launch as you read this, but that's not all it has up its sleeve for Switch. According to Tomoya Asano, division executive at Square Enix, more is on the way from the RPG juggernaut.

During my conversation with the team at Acquire and Square Enix about Octopath Traveler, Asano mentioned that the team became its own division in April. "Square Enix has decided that it wants to focus on original titles for the Switch," he says. "If Octopath Traveler does well and this is something that appeals to fans, we want to focus on Switch. Please pick up the Switch if you want to play games like Octopath Traveler."

There are several other titles we're currently working on for Switch.

When I ask Asano if games were already in development, or if Square Enix's future on the platform is contingent upon Octopath Traveler's success, he clarified his statement. "There are several other titles that we're currently working on for Switch," he says. "If you could just wait a bit longer, we'll work with Nintendo and announce them in the future."

No timetable was given for these future announcements, but it certainly seems as though Square Enix is all in on Nintendo's latest platform. With both Square Enix and Nintendo holding their own streamed presentations in the lead up to E3 next week, it's entirely possible that we'll see one or more of these projects announced, but nothing is confirmed as of now.

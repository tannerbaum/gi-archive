  RoboCop: Rogue City Shows Off Action-Packed Gameplay Trailer






            During today's Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of theÂ upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.

RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.

You can see the action unfold for yourself below.

Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

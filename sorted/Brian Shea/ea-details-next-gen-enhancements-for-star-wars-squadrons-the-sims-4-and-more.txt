  EA Details Next-Gen Enhancements For Star Wars: Squadrons, The Sims 4, And More






            With the next generation of consoles less than a week away, Electronic Arts has announced what improvements and enhancements its most recent and active games will feature on the new systems. Next-gen versions of FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21 arrive on December 4, offering free next-gen upgrades for those who own the current-gen version. The next-gen version of Madden NFL 21 lets you bring forward progress from Ultimate Team, The Yard, and both franchise modes, while the next-gen FIFA 21 carries forward your Ultimate Team and VOLTA progress.

Thanks to the backwards compatibility features of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, your existing current-gen EA games will perform even better when you fire up your new systems.

However, all versions will benefit from improved load times and better framerates. EA Sports will be detailing the next-gen version of FIFA 21 ahead of its December 4 launch.

The base game and all expansions carry forward, including the 10th expansion which launches next week. If you play The Sims 4 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, you'll see improved load times and smoother framerate.

Star Wars: Squadrons

PlayStation 5
Star Wars: Squadrons runs with improved lighting on PS5 at the same resolution and framerate as the PS4 Pro.

Xbox Series X/S
Star Wars: Squadrons offers up two options on Xbox Series X/S: better visual quality or better performance. Better visual quality means an improved lighting model, running up to 2160p/60 FPS on Series X and up to 1440p/60 fps on Series S. Better performance takes that same resolution and bumps it up to up 120 FPS on both of Xbox's consoles. If you have a television that supports Variable Refresh Rates, Motive added a toggle in the menu for that.

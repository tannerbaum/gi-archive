  Check Out The New Pokémon Trading Card Game Battle Academy Set






            With more than 80 expansions and increasingly complex mechanics, the Pokémon Trading Card Game can be difficult to fully grasp for those who haven't played a CCG before. While it's certainly one of the more approachable card games, the Pokémon Company wanted to make sure people who have never even thought about battling with cards could do so with Pokémon Trading Card Game Battle Academy.

This set comes packaged like a board game and includes everything you need to learn how to play the Pokémon Trading Card Game and get through a match in under 30 minutes. The box includes three decks, the game board, tutorial guides, and a rulebook, as well as a special large coin featuring the stars of the included decks: Pikachu, Mewtwo, and Charizard. You also get damage counters and a code card for Pokémon Trading Card Game Online.

Pokémon Trading Card Game Battle Academy is available now. For more on the Pokémon Trading Card Game, check out our big galleries for many of the most recent expansions.

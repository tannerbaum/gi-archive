  Pokémon Unite Is A MOBA-Style Game For Switch And Mobile






            During last week's Pokémon Presents, president and CEO of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara followed up the announcements of New Pokémon Snap, Pokémon Café Mix, and other announcements by teasing more big news today. That "big project" Ishihara teased turned out to be Pokémon Unite.

The game is created in partnership with Tencent Games and TiMi Studios. Pokémon Unite is a 5v5 team-based game with a focus on being highly accessible while also delivering depth. The game features MOBA-style gameplay with various moves and score locations. Player-controlled Pokémon can explore the lanes of the battlefield to capture wild Pokémon to score and evolve to improve their stats. Of course, you can also expect to clash with opposing players on the battlefield.

Pokémon Unite is a free-to-start game coming to Switch, iOS, and Android.

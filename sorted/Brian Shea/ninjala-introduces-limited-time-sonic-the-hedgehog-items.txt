  Ninjala Introduces Limited-Time Sonic The Hedgehog Items






            The free-to-play bubble-gum brawler from GungHo, Ninjala, has begun its collaboration with the Sonic the Hedgehog brand through several in-game items. The items included in the collaboration feature outfits, Ippon decorations, stickers, and a special Gum Utsusemi transformation.

Starting today and running through October 21, players can buy these items from the game shop. The items can be earned through regular play or purchased using real money. Those looking for new outfits can pick up new duds modeled after Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. If you're hoping to score a new Ippon decoration, this collaboration adds new ones featuring Sonic and Dr. Eggman. This event also offers Sonic and Dr. Eggman stickers, as well as a special Dr. Eggman Gum Utsusemi transformation. 

You can see the items on offer in the gallery below.

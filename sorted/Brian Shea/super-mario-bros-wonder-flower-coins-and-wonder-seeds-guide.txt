  Super Mario Bros. Wonder Flower Coins And Wonder Seeds Guide






            Super Mario Bros. Wonder is out now, and if you're anything like us, you're playing through it, trying to find every secret the game has to offer (read our review right here). The two main collectibles come in the form of 10 Flower Coins and Wonder Seeds. Each main stage has three 10 Flower Coins for you to collect, while each main stage features at least two Wonder Seeds for you to grab. While the Wonder Seeds are tied to each exit a stage has, you also get one for collecting a Wonder Flower and completing the corresponding Wonder Effect. 

Below, you'll see the locations of every single 10 Flower Coin (we'll just call them Flower Coins from here on out) and Wonder Seed. Some of them are more easily attained with certain Badges, while others require a bit of hunting around or a skillful, well-timed sequence of jumps. Since this is all about revealing the locations of the game's main collectibles, proceed with caution if you are concerned about spoilers for how the stages play out, but also for the existence of certain elements, enemies, and even areas in the game. But if you're in this guide, we're pretty sure you already know what you're getting into. Without further ado, here is the list of every Flower Coin and Wonder Flower in Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

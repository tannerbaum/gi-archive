  16-Bit RPG Hazelnut Bastille Coming To Switch, Adding Secret Of Mana Composer






Aloft Studio has announced that its 16-bit RPG Hazelnut Bastille is coming to Switch in addition to its planned PC, Mac, and Linux releases. The studio also announced the retro RPG is adding composer Hiroki Kikuta, best known for his work on the beloved 1993 RPG Secret of Mana.

Hazelnut Bastille takes inspiration from SNES favorites like Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid. The game's story features a young woman on an adventure to retrieve something that she lost. To reclaim what was once hers, she must travel to the outskirts of her world to a foreign shore.

Originally announced for PC, Mac, and Linux, Hazelnut Bastille is now set to arrive on Switch, either simultaneously or in the months following release on those platforms. The game is currently set for a 2019 launch.

Our Take
The addition of Hiroki Kikuta certainly ups the nostalgia factor of a title already overflowing with retro aesthetic. The addition of the Switch to the game's platform list seems like a no-brainer given how much it appears to be inspired by games that made their marks on the SNES. I'm excited to check this out when it releases.

  Theatrhythm Final Bar Line Brings Nearly 400 Classic Final Fantasy Songs This February






            Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.

The soundtrack includes favorites like "One Winged Angel," "Torn from the Heavens," "Suteki Da Ne," and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.

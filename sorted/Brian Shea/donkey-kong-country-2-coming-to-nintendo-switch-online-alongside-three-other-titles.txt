  Donkey Kong Country 2 Coming To Nintendo Switch Online Alongside Three Other Titles






            Hot off the surprise addition of Super Mario All-Stars to the Super NES library of Nintendo Switch Online earlier this month, Nintendo has announced the full lineup of September additions to its subscription catalog. In addition to the already-released Super Mario All-Stars, the Super NES library will receive three new additions, while the NES library will see one new game.

The headliner this month is undoubtedly Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest (pictured above). The follow up to the iconic SNES platformer sees Diddy and Dixie Kong taking the spotlight in an adventure to save Donkey Kong from the clutches of King K. Rool. In addition, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can look forward to adding puzzle game Mario's Super Picross and action title The Peace Keepers on the SNES side, while NES enthusiasts have S.C.A.T.: Special Cybernetic Attack Team coming at them.

In order to access the ever-growing library of classic games available on Switch, which includes titles like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Mario World, Super Metroid, and Super Mario Kart, you must be a subscriber to Nintendo Switch Online. The service, which also grants you access to Switch games' online features, also gives you the ability to play downloadable titles like Tetris 99 and the upcoming Super Mario Bros. 35 at no additional cost.

These new Nintendo Switch Online additions arrive on September 23.

  Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Collector's Edition And Amiibo Announced






            During today's Nintendo Direct presentation, we saw plenty of new footage of one of the most anticipated games of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While you can read all about that right here, we also got some news surrounding some additional ways fans can celebrate the launch of the follow-up to 2017's Breath of the Wild.

First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges. This Collector's Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link's paraglider.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.

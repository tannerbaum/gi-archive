  Kirby And The Forgotten Land, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Analogue Pocket | All Things Nintendo






            After a slow news week to kick off 2022, the world of Nintendo is firing on all cylinders, so this episode of All Things Nintendo is all about catching up on the new looks at Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Kirby and the Forgotten Land. Not only that, but Game Informer's Alex Van Aken also came ready to chat about the all-new Analogue Pocket and The Nintendo Tapes, his new collaborative EP of Nintendo remixes (two of which you'll sample during this episode!).

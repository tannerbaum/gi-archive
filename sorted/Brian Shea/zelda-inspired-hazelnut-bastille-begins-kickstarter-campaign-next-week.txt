  Zelda-Inspired Hazelnut Bastille Begins Kickstarter Campaign Next Week






            Aloft Studio has announced that its 16-bit action title, Hazelnut Bastille, will launch its Kickstarter campaign in less than a week. The developer had previously announced that Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta is contributing to the soundtrack.

Hazelnut Bastille takes direct inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Aloft hopes to stay true to the style through visuals, soundtrack, and overall level design. The story focuses on a young girl on a quest to a far-off land to retrieve something that was lost to her. Looking at the trailer below, it's easy to see and hear the Zelda inspiration.

The Kickstarter campaign is set to launch on October 23 at 8 a.m. Eastern and will run through November 29. You can watch the first full trailer for Hazelnut Bastille below.

Hazelnut Bastille is currently set to release on Switch, PC, Mac, and Linux. Additional platforms could be added depending on the success of the crowdfunding campaign; a PS4 release is currently a stretch goal.

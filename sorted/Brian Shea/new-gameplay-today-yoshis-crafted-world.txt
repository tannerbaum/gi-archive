  New Gameplay Today – Yoshi's Crafted World






            Yoshi's Crafted World is the latest adventure for Nintendo's friendly green dino and his rainbow cast of friends. Much like Woolly World before it, Yoshi's Crafted World applies a unique, material-based aesthetic. However, instead of wool, Crafted World makes everything look like it was made by a child using household items.

I'm currently in the process of playing Yoshi's Crafted World for our review, but you'll have to wait a couple weeks for I can give you those in-depth impressions. Instead, you can get my early thoughts in the video above. Watch as I play a few levels, run away from a giant bone dinosaur, and fight against an alligator train, all while Ben and Nathan distract me with questions.

Yoshi's Crafted World hits Switch on March 29.

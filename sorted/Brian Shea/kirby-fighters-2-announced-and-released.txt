  Kirby Fighters 2 Announced And Released






            Kirby is among Nintendo's most versatile characters thanks to his ability to copy movesets. While HAL's beloved pink puff has been been in Super Smash Bros. since the series' inception, Nintendo is bringing back the Kirby Fighters series, which debuted in 2014 on 3DS as a part of Kirby: Triple Deluxe. This standalone entry comes to Switch with a variety of new modes and features.

Kirby Fighters 2 lets you play in single-handed mode, where you try to get the best possible clear time in a series of solo battles, and multiplayer, where up to four players can battle it out locally on the same Switch, locally on the same network, or online through Nintendo Switch Online with customizable rulesets. Kirby Fighters 2 also delivers a story mode, where you fight alongside a human- or A.I.-controlled companion to scale the tower, choose from items to help between rounds, and defeat King Dedede and Meta Knight's challenges. The items offer buffs to stats, your health, and more. 

In addition to the new Wrestler moveset, players can play as a variety of classic Kirby styles including Sword, Beam, Artist, Yo-Yo, Water, and more. In addition, if you'd rather not play as Kirby, you can select from some of his most well-known adversaries like Banana Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and others. Between Kirby's various movesets and the other playable characters, you can choose between a total of 22 different fighting styles.

Kirby Fighters 2 is available now for Switch.

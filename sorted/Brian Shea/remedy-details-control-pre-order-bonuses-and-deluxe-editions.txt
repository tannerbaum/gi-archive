  Remedy Details Control Pre-Order Bonuses And Deluxe Editions






We've been revealing new information about Control, the new supernatural action game from the minds behind Alan Wake and Max Payne, but Remedy has one more announcement before the month concludes. Through a leak on the Microsoft Store last week, we learned that Control launches on August 27. Now we know what players who pre-order Control will receive in return.

If you pre-order the standard edition of the game for $60, you receive two exclusive in-game items: Jesse's Tactical Response Gear outfit and a Crafting Resources pack. Pre-orders of the PS4 version also receive rare Service Weapon and character modes, the Astral Dive suit for Jesse, and two themes featuring the game.

The physical Retail Deluxe Edition is available for PS4 and Xbox One for $70 and comes with exclusive metal packaging and limited edition art cards. The PS4 Digital Deluxe Edition is $80 and comes with all of the items in the standard PS4 edition, as well as an extra side mission called "Isolation," and Jesse's Urban Response Gear outfit. The PS4 Digital Deluxe Edition also includes both expansion packs, "The Foundation" and "AWE," which will release after launch.

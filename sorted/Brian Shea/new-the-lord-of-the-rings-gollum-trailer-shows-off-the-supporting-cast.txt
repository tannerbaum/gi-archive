  New The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum Trailer Shows Off The Supporting Cast






            When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was first announced, some questioned how interesting a game based on the shadow-lurking hobbit could be. In the latest trailer, Gollum is still the focus, but it seems like we're going to get a host of recognizable faces from J.R.R. Tolkien's universe.

This all-original story takes you all around Middle-earth in search of Gollum's Precious, which he has lost. Developer Daedalic Entertainment says players should expect to use Gollum's agility and guile to avoid the dangers on this journey. Though he's not a fighter, players can expect to stealthily assassinate those who would pose a threat to him or take care of them in other creative ways. Based on the decisions you make, you directly influence his split personality as he toes the line between Gollum and Sméagol.

You can see the new trailer from today, which shows off some of the more familiar faces Gollum will interact with on this journey, below.

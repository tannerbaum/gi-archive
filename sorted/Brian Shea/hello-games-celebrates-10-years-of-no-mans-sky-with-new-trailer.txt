  Hello Games Celebrates 10 Years Of No Man's Sky With New Trailer






            Ten years ago, at Geoff Keighley's awards show (then known as the VGX Awards), the development team at Hello Games revealed No Man's Sky. The ambitious space-exploration title promised a universe of possibilities and has since become the poster child for bouncing back from a challenging launch period.

To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first teaser trailer, Sean Murray and Hello Games returned to Geoff Keighley's stage, now called The Game Awards, to give a brief retrospective and tease what's next. After a rundown of the last 10 years of active development of No Man's Sky, including several free updates, improvements, and expansions, the trailer teases big plans for 2024, with something that appears to involve more intricate space stations within the game.

No Man's Sky was released in 2016 to mixed reviews but received myriad updates and improvements in the years since, delivering something beyond what was even promised in the lead-up to launch. Today, it is widely praised by critics and fans and is put forward as the foremost model for how to improve a game after a rocky launch.

  Zelda Movie, Recent Games We Missed | All Things Nintendo






            This week on All Things Nintendo, we discuss the blockbuster news that Nintendo is making a live-action Legend of Zelda movie. After talking about the other news of the week, Brian and Wes dive into some recent Switch games they missed when they first came out due to how busy the fall release calendar has been.

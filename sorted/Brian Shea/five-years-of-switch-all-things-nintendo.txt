  Five Years Of Switch | All Things Nintendo






            This week's episode of All Things Nintendo is all about celebrating the first five years of the Nintendo Switch. The anniversary is right around the corner, so Brian invites Game Informer online content director Ben Reeves back to talk about the biggest milestones of the Switch's first half-decade, as well as share some stories from the last five years covering the system.

Note: Brian is out on assignment this week, so this episode was recorded a week early. If any noteworthy news hit over the last week, All Things Nintendo will cover it next week.

  Iron Man VR Hits PSVR In February






Iron Man VR was announced in March and has looked promising ever since. However, while we've gotten our hands on a small demo for the game, we've been eagerly anticipating playing the full release. During today's Marvel Games panel at New York Comic Con, Marvel revealed we'll finally have that opportunity on February 28.

IGN reports the panel, which is not being streamed, also including the game's first story trailer. We'll update this story once that trailer hits the internet. Iron Man VR launches on PSVR February 28, 2020.

Update: PlayStation has shared the story trailer, which you can see below.

  Pokémon Remakes | All Things Nintendo






            Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are out now. However, if you listened to episode two of All Things Nintendo, we already extensively covered what these remakes bring to the table. Instead of retreading old ground, this episode shifts the focus to the Pokémon series' long-standing tradition of bringing remade versions of its older games to modern platforms. Host Brian Shea invites fellow Game Informer editor John Carson back to retrace the history of Pokémon remakes before getting some final thoughts on Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

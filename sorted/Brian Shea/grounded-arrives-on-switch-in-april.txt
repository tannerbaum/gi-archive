  Grounded Arrives On Switch In April






            Following last week's Xbox podcast, where Phil Spencer said that four previous Xbox exclusives would be coming to additional platforms in the near future, today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase revealed the first of the four. Grounded, a four-player survival game where players assume the roles of children shrunken down to the size of bugs, is coming to Switch this April.

Grounded originally launched on Xbox One and PC in Early Access in June 2020, where it stayed until September 2022. This is in line with Spencer's comments that the Xbox games coming to other platforms will have been exclusive on Xbox for at least a year. The other rumored Xbox titles to come to other platforms are Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and another Obsidian game, Pentiment. 

Grounded arrives on Switch on April 16 with cross-platform co-op, but you can also take on the miniaturized backyard challenges solo. For more on Grounded, check out our coverage hub right here.

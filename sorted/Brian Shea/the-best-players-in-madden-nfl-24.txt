  The Best Players In Madden NFL 24






            Following its announcement in June, we traveled to EA Sports in Redwood City, California, to learn all about what players can expect from this iteration of the long-running Madden NFL franchise. Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. 

However, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season. Not only does this give fans, players, and media personalities various talking points about which players are overrated and underrated, but it also lets us know which teams will be the most fun to play when the game launches.

This week, EA Sports and EA Tiburon opened the floodgates on its highest-rated players, giving us several athletes included in this year's Madden NFL 99 Club. Included in the 99 Club is Aaron Donald, who breaks the record for most appearances as a part of that group with his seventh appearance. The previous record holder was quarterback Peyton Manning, with six appearances. 

But he isn't the only member of this prestigious category. Check out the highest-rated players stepping on the field below. Members of the Madden NFL 24 99 Club are bolded.

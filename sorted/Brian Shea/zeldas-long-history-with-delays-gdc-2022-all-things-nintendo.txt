  Zelda's Long History With Delays, GDC 2022 | All Things Nintendo






            The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's sequel received another delay, this time pushing it out of 2022, so for this week's All Things Nintendo, Brian is joined by Jill Grodt to run down the series' long history with delays. After discussing some quick news items, the two dive into the series' delays of the past, stretching all the way back to an article from 1988.

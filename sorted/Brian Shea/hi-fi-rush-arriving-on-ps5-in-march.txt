  Hi-Fi Rush Arriving On PS5 In March






            Following today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.

Hi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.

Hi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer's 2023 "Best Microsoft Exclusive" award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

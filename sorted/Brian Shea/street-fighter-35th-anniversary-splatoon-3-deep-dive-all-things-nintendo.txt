  Street Fighter 35th Anniversary, Splatoon 3 Deep Dive | All Things Nintendo






            This week on All Things Nintendo, Brian invites fighting game expert and former Game Informer editor Suriel Vazquez to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Street Fighter franchise. The main segment pays homage to the series through a deep dive on the history and impact of the most iconic fighting games, but before that, the two run down the news, including a big breakdown of the Splatoon 3 info dump we got earlier this week.

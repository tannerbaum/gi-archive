  Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Demo Available Now






            At the tail-end of today's PlayStation State of Play devoted to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, fans were treated to the announcement that a demo is available now for those who can't wait to jump into the highly anticipated adventure. The title, which was featured on the cover of Game Informer issue 362 and won "Most Anticipated Game" at The Game Awards 2023, is less than a month from release.

The demo puts you in the shoes of Cloud and Sephiroth during the impactful Nibelheim episode. In that sequence, which we played during our previous coverage, you fight through various enemies as you climb Mt. Nibel, allowing you to experience the relationship between Cloud and Sephiroth before things sour between them. It was a fun way to whet my appetite when I played it back in December, and it'll likely do the same for players of this demo. Later this month, Square Enix will update the demo to include some exploration within the Junon region.

Those who want to download the demo of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth can do so through the PlayStation Store page here. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives on February 29 on PlayStation 5.

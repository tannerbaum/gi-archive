            This week on All Things Nintendo, Brian and Indie Informer's Jill Grodt run down the best indie games that came to Switch over the last calendar year. Brian and Jill chat about their favorite indies and hidden gems of the year, giving you plenty of ideas of games you may have missed and want to check out now that the game release schedule is slowing down.

Each week, Brian is joined by different guests to talk about what's happening in the world of Nintendo. Along the way, they'll share personal stories, uncover hidden gems in the eShop, and even look back on the classics we all grew up with. A new episode hits every Friday!

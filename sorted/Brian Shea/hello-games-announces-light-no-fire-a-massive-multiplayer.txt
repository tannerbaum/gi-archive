  Hello Games Announces Light No Fire, A Massive Multiplayer Exploration-Based Fantasy Game






            Following Hello Games' celebratory video commemorating 10 years since the initial No Man's Sky reveal trailer, Sean Murray had one more video for viewers of The Game Awards. The trailer showed off an all-new game called Light No Fire, which appears to be on a similar level of ambition as the universe-sprawling No Man's Sky.

Rather than going full science fiction as it did with No Man's Sky, Hello Games opted to explore a fantasy setting this time around. With a massive, Earth-like planet to explore alongside huge groups of people, Light No Fire lets you scale mountains, scour the surface, swim beneath the waves, and even soar through the skies on the backs of dragons. The beautiful world appears to be yours for the taking, as you can harvest resources, fight off encroaching enemies, and even build settlements.

No release window was given for Light No Fire, but if what Hello Games showed off at The Game Awards is any indication, the wait for this one could prove excruciating. While No Man's Sky shows little signs of slowing down, I can't wait to see what else this talented team has up its sleeves.

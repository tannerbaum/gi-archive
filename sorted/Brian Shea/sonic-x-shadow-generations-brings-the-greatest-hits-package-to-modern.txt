  Sonic X Shadow Generations Brings The Greatest Hits Package To Modern Consoles






            In 2011, as the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise turned 20 years old, Sega and Sonic Team decided to celebrate with Sonic Generations, a game that remade various iconic and fan-favorite zones from Sonic's past in both 3D and modern 2D versions. The title was one of the more well-liked Sonic games of the era, alongside Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed. During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sega announced a new version of Sonic Generations called Sonic x Shadow Generations.

As the name implies, Sonic x Shadow Generations remasters the well-liked title for modern consoles but adds various enhancements. While 60 frames-per-second performance is already attainable by playing the Xbox 360 version on an Xbox Series X console, Sonic x Shadow Generations brings much more to the table. In addition to remastering the Sonic levels, this version adds Shadow as a playable character alongside new levels for him.

Sonic x Shadow Generations will be available this fall for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

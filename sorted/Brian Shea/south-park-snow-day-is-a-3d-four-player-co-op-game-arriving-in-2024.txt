  South Park: Snow Day Is A 3D Four-Player Co-Op Game Arriving In 2024






            During today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we learned about a new game starring everyone's favorite raunchy Colorado kids. South Park: Snow Day looks to carry on the series' legacy of over-the-top and mature-rated humor while still viewing life through the eyes of children. 

Starring the core group of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, players take part in celebrations surrounding the magical occasion of a snow day. Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.

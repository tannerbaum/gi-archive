  Chrono Trigger Composer Contributing To Sea Of Stars Soundtrack






            Announced last month by The Messenger developer Sabotage, Sea of Stars draws heavy inspiration from retro role-playing games like Illusion of Gaia and Breath of Fire. However, perhaps the biggest inspiration for the studio in creating Sea of Stars is Chrono Trigger. Now, that DNA is even more ingrained, as the legendary composer behind Chrono Trigger, Yasunori Mitsuda, is contributing music to the soundtrack, joining Sea of Stars and The Messenger composer Eric W. Brown.

"Without knowing exactly why, 'I want to write music for this game' was the feeling I had while seeing it convey the nostalgic golden age of the '90s," Mitsuda said in a press release. "Although there are still many games being released with this classic style, I don't think players are satisfied with just nostalgia. As seen in their previous game, by adding new systems and ideas to classic formulas, Sabotage Studios breathes fresh, new air into their work."

In addition to Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda composed the soundtracks for Xenogears, Mario Party, and more, and has contributed to myriad soundtracks including Xenoblade Chronicles, Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ignis, and Kid Icarus: Uprising. Sea of Stars launched its Kickstarter campaign in mid-March. It quickly surpassed its goal, and with 10 days to go in the fundraising campaign, it has attracted nearly five times its original target of $93,780. Sea of Stars is set to come to consoles and PC in 2022.

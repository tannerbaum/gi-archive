            This week on All Things Nintendo, Brian is joined by Marcus Stewart, who gives his hands-on impressions of Another Code: Recollection, Nintendo's first published release of 2024. The series got its start on the DS before receiving a Japan and Europe-only sequel on the Wii. Now, both titles are available on Switch. The two also run through the latest news, give an eShop Gem of the Week, and discuss which Zelda game they'd like to see remade.

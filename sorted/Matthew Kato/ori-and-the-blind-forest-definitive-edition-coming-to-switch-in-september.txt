  Ori And The Blind Forest: Definitive Edition Coming To Switch In September






            During Nintendo's Indie World Showcase, Moon Studios announced that Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition is coming to the Switch on September 27.

The Definitive Edition was released for the PC and Xbox One in 2016, and it features new areas, abilities, story segments, and more.

The game was originally published by Microsoft, but like Minecraft, is yet another partnership between Microsoft and Nintendo for games appearing on the Switch.

Developer Moon Studios is currently working on Ori and the Will of the Wisps for release on February 11, 2020 on Xbox One and PC.

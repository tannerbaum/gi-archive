  Hunt: Showdown Coming To Xbox Game Preview This Spring






            Last fall Crytek announced that its Steam Early Access game was moving over to Microsoft's similar pre-release campaign, Xbox Game Preview. Now the developer/publisher has delivered a timeframe for the game, announcing that it'll be in the Game Preview program this spring.

Hunt: Showdown drops players in Louisiana, tasking them with picking up bounties for monsters terrorizing the countryside. Of course, things aren't so straightforward, because once you defeat your target, you become one yourself as other hunters try and steal your prize.

  Kratos to Destroy NASCAR






They say people only watch NASCAR for the crashes. Well, what better way to give people the destruction they crave than to put God of War III's Kratos on your hood? NASCAR Nationwide driver Joey Logano and GameStop are once again teaming up for this weekend's race at Bristol.
God of War III's Kratos and GameStop [GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer – Ed.] will adorn the hood of Joey Logano's #20 Toyota Camry at this week's Nationwide race at Bristol, and we certainly wouldn't want to get in the way. Last month, Logano rolled out at Fontana with a Big Daddy on his side, and ended up stomping his way to a fifth-place finish. The tight confines of Bristol are exactly where you'd want a warrior like Kratos on your side to slice up, smash, and terrorize the competition.

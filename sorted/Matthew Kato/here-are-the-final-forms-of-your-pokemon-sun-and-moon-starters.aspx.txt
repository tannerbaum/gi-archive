Pokémon Sun


  Here Are The Final Forms Of Your Pokémon Sun & Moon Starters




Pokémon Sun & Moon developer Game Freak has already revealed the evolved form of your starter Pokémon, and today they go a step further and uncover those starters' final evolutions.

Rowlet –> Dartrix –> Decidueye (signature move: Spirit Shackle, which keeps the opponent from switching out)

Litton –> Torracat –> Incineroar (signature move: Darkest Lariat. This ignores the opponent's stat change)

Popplio –> Brionne –> Primarina (signature move: Sparkling Aria, which heals burns)

The video below also describes the Guardians of Alola and the fact that they share a unique Z-Move. Finally, you can go up against other trainers at the Battle Tree and through the Pokémon League.

Pro Evolution 2013 seems to be making a big feature push this year, with a variety of additions in all areas of the game.
Konami and developer PES Productions have just released a new trailer for the game showing off just a few of its key elements.
Online Communities: Form these with friends in your area, and take on each other or other communities (you can seamlessly invite people to online matches even while you're playing offline). You'll get a Rival Rating based on your performance, and be placed in a tier with similar competition. Everything you do in the game will be tracked via the MyPES feature, which can push all your activity to your Facebook account.
Football Life: Last year included more cinematic menu information, and this year the career mode is getting an upgraded item system. Earn points to buy training items for your club, which in turn boost your players' skills and attributes in various ways.
Performance Training: Work your way through myriad on-the-field drills that encompass different controls and situations to better your skills.

Deus Ex: Mankind Divided


  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Welcomes You To The World In 2029




Game artwork isn't just doodling, it's an important part of the development process that helps the team establish a mindset for the project. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided developer Eidos Montreal has just released artwork showing what some of the world's most famous cities will look like two years after the Aug Incident.
The Aug Incident of 2027 was when those humans with augmentations went berserk and millions were killed in the ensuing chaos. Mankind Divided occurs two years after the Aug Incident, with the world at odds over the issue of mechanical augmentation.
Scroll down to the media gallery below of futuristic glimpses of cities like London, Stockholm, and Berlin.
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided releases for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 23. For more info, check out the game's other recent blurring of the lines between it and real-life, and click on the hub banner below for more info from our May 2015 cover story.

Deus Ex: Mankind Divided


  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's Adam Jensen Is Armed And Very Dangerous




Adam Jensen is an augmented operative chasing the threads of a worldwide conspiracy. People may hate augmentations, but this latest trailer for the November 23 game shows that they can be pretty useful.
The trailer not only touches on how people with augmentations are shunned in the world, but how Jensen is seen by his own counter-terrorism unit. Plus, you can get a look at his Titan shield, the nanoblade, and a new gun-arm augmentation – The Tesla.

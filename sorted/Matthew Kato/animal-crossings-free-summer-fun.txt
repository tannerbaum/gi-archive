  Animal Crossing's Free Summer Fun






            Summer is here, and maybe you've been going to the beach in real-life. Or maybe not. Either way, Animal Crossing: New Horizon's free summer update (coming on July 3) is bringing the seasonal fun to the Switch.

The update features swimming, diving, mermaid furniture, additions for the museum, and more. 

July's update is just the beginning, as Nintendo says another free entry is coming in early August.

            Reveal trailers are just that – they're meant to debut the game but not necessarily explain it. The other week Madden 21 had its debut, teasing some of this year's features but not going in more depth to what would be happening. That paves the way for today, with developer EA Tiburon a new trailer covering gameplay aspects on both sides of the ball.

Usually when a feature for offense is added there needs to be a counter on defense, and vice versa. This year the addition of more right stick moves applies equally to everyone. Defensive linemen's moves are now all on the right stick and triggers, and there's actually an optional onscreen meter showing how many you have left. Furthermore, offensive linemen learn from what you've done, so you'll need a varied arsenal to penetrate into the backfield.

Out in the open field, ball carriers are getting the side hurdle and a dead-leg pause. Both seem like they're less time-consuming and transition easier into continuing to run that the traditional full juke and jump back. Thus, it'll be interesting to see how balanced they are considering normal spin moves are already strong against players without a tackling superstar ability.

Speaking of making tackles, defenders will have another tool available to them through stuttering breakdown steps that help them prepare and size up an open field tackle.

These additions – as well as more animations for post-play momentum, sideline activity, QB throws, and user-generated celebrations for non-TD events like sacks and first downs – can help the game look good on your TV. However, the real test will be how accurate the game is at triggering and resolving these animations correctly, something I mention as one of the challenges for the series this year.

Of course, we won't know how it all plays out until we get our hands on the game. EA Tiburon will have to blend all these situations together to make the experience seamless, providing that flow like that of a great running back or defensive end.

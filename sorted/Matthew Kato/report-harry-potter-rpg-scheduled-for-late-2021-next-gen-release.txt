  Report: Harry Potter RPG Scheduled For Late-2021 Next-Gen Release






Bloomberg is confirming the earlier report of an open-world Harry Potter RPG by Warner Bros. studio Avalanche Software (Disney Infinity), adding that the game will appear on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in late 2021.

The information is based on conversations with two people working on the project, and Bloomberg's article in general gives an overview of the game's development, stating that the early video footage was real even if some information since its leak has not been.

COVID-19, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's transphobic comments, and the possible sale of Avalanche parent company Warner Bros. have affected the title's development, even though it remains on track to release next year.

The RPG was supposed to be announced at E3 in June, but will now make its debut after Batman goes first in August at DC's Fandome event.

  Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 Also Coming To The PlayStation 5






            As is often the case when a console manufacturer touts upcoming a third-party game for its new system, whether the title is exclusive or not can be confusing. In the case of Vampire The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 from Paradox Interactive (developed by Hardsuit Labs), the game – which was showcased in yesterday's Inside Xbox presentation for Xbox Series X – is also coming to the PlayStation 5.

Today Paradox released another version of yesterday's trailer, only this time the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC logos have been added to the end. This isn't a huge surprise since the game was already confirmed for the current platforms (PS4, Xbox One, and PC).

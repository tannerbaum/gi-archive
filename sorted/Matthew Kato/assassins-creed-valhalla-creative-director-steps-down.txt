  Assassin's Creed Valhalla Creative Director Steps Down






Note: This story has been updated to include additional context.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail is stepping down from his role with the game to deal with "personal issues."

I am stepping down from my beloved project to properly deal with the personal issues in my life. The lives of my family and my own are shattered. I am deeply sorry to everyone hurt in this.

In response to the situation, Ubisoft has provided a statement that reads: "Ashraf Ismail is stepping down from the project to take a leave of absence. The development team is committed to delivering a great game in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla."

The announcement comes on the heels of information that came to light this weekend, regarding an alleged sexual relationship between Ismail and a woman who didn't know he was married.

The revelation surfaces as Ubisoft is already dealing with another separate controversy surrounding the sexual conduct of its employees.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is currently scheduled to release for current- and next-gen systems, as well as PC and Stadia, by the end of the year.

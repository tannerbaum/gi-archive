  Update: Kobe Bryant Added As NBA 2K21's Final Cover Star






            Final Update:

The late Kobe Bryant is the cover star for NBA 2K21's Mamba Forever edition, which includes various extras through the game's modes, including 100,000 VC, 60 MyCareer skill boosts, and more.

This version, which comes out this holiday for $99.99, is available for both the current and next-gen consoles, and buying it is the only way that fans can play on both generations (within the same console family such as PS4 and PS5) with a single purchase.

Microsoft has started its own Smart Delivery system which ensures that you only have to buy a game once no matter which generation you play the game on, but so far the list of third-party titles using this feature is selective.

For more information on this edition, head over to the official site.

Update:

Pelicans' forward Zion Williamson has been added as NBA 2K21's cover star for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of this year's game.

2K says that more information on the game comes tomorrow when the release date, third and final cover star, and pre-order campaign are announced.

Original Story:

Being a cover star is a career milestone, and this year Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard is adding that accolade to his already distinguished resume.

Lillard is the cover star of the current-gen version of the game out of a total of three, with the other two (next-gen and Legend edition) still to follow.

Not much has been said by developer Visual Concepts about the game itself so far, but the next-gen version was recently unveiled at Sony's event, and it should make use of the upcoming systems with shorter load times, etc.

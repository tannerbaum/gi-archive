  Report: Microsoft Announcing Xbox Series S In August






Xbox Series X

It has long been rumored that Microsoft is preparing a second next-gen system codenamed Lockhart which is cheaper and less high-powered than the announced Xbox Series X. Eurogamer reports that this version – also known as the Xbox Series S – is going to debut in August.

The Series S – named similar to the cheaper Xbox One S – was originally going to debut in June at E3, but Microsoft had to change those plans when the industry event was canceled.

Microsoft has yet to announce the official date and price for the Series X, but it will be out this holiday season. Whether the Series S releases alongside the Series X also remains to be seen. Perhaps all will be revealed in August.

  Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time Leaked By Ratings Board






Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy

The Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee has rated the unannounced Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Toys for Bob, the studio behind the well-received Spyro Reignited trilogy of remasters, is developing the title.

Here's some background for the game as well:

Crash is relaxing and exploring his island in his time, 1998, when he finds a mysterious mask hidden away in a cave, Lani-Loli. The mask is one of the Quantum Masks and apparently knows Aku-Aku, Crash’s mask friend! With the Quantum Masks returning and a Quantum Rift appearing near our heroes, they decide to bravely head through to different times and dimensions to stop whoever is responsible.

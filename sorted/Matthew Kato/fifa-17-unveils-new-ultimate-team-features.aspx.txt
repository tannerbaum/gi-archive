  FIFA 17 Unveils New Ultimate Team Features




Ultimate Team is a popular destination for FIFA players, and today at Gamescom publisher/developer EA Sports debuted the mode's newest additions.
FUT Champions is a competitive mode with daily knockout tourneys that qualify players for the weekend league, and from there a climb up the monthly leaderboards.
Both FUT Champions and the new Squad Building Challenges get you in-game rewards like coins, kits, and packs. Squad Building Challenges are just that – perimeters for forming a team like only being able to choose from two countries.
Similar to previous years, Xbox owners can look forward to another round of exclusive Legends. This year it's: Marc Overmars, Paul Scholes, Jamie Carragher, Alessandro Del Piero, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Carlos Puyol, Juan Sebastian Veron, Emmanuel Petit, Rio Ferdinand, and Luis Hernandez.
This year's Ultimate Team also includes specially FUT kits (from the likes of the band Kasabian) and the ability to download your FUT squad and play against a friend locally/offline.
Speaking of getting personal, EA Sports has announced the in-person Ultimate Team Championship Series (Xbox One and PS4 players) for a $1.3 million prize pool. Players qualify for the series through regional events, FUT Champions results, and other events.
Also released today was a new gameplay trailer featuring some of the game's new skill moves, celebrations, and signings, which you can check out below.

  Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories Is Coming To The West In 2020






            Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories came out in Japan in last year, and now it's making its way stateside in early 2020 courtesy of publisher NIS America. The title's first trailer has just been released, showing off some dire circumstances requiring true heroism.

Players will survive, escape, and help others after an earthquake and the resulting chaos (including aftershocks) devastates the city. The title reportedly features extensive player-customization options for the series, as well as dozens of characters.

The game also includes PSVR support via a separate mode.

Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is coming to the PS4, Switch, and PC.

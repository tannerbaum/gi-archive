  Dragon Ball FighterZ Janemba DLC Leaks Intensify






A now-removed post at Nintendo UK is the latest indication that Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn villain Janemba is the next DLC character for Dragon Ball FighterZ.

Siliconera spotted the page, which included a content description listing five alternate outfit colors, a Janemba lobby avatar, and his Z stamp.

This is hardly the first time Janemba's name has been evoked in the name of the game's DLC. Earlier this year he surfaced as a candidate, and this spring none other than Microsoft's Major Nelson mentioned Janemba when talking about season 2 characters for the game.

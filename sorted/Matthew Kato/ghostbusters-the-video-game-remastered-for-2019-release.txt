  Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered For 2019 Release






            Have you or your family actually seen a spook, specter, or ghost? If so, perhaps playing the upcoming remaster of Ghostbusters: The Video Game will calm you down. The game, an update of the Terminal Reality title from 2009 is out sometime in 2019 on the PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games store).

The remaster features cutscenes and in-game video and 4K as well as improved textures and lighting. This augments a story that takes place after the second movie written by Dan Akyroyd and the late Harold Ramis, who – along with fellow co-stars Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson – have lent their voices and likenesses to great effect.

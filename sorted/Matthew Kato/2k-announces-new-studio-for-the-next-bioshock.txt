  2K Announces New Studio For The Next BioShock






            2K has formed a new internal studio called Cloud Chamber which is handling the next title in the BioShock series. The game will "be in development for the next several years."

The developer will work out of two locations: 2K's Novato, California headquarters and a new studio in Montréal, Québec, and Cloud Chamber is headed by Kelley Gilmore. Gilmore has worked within 2K on executive production, marketing, and PR for almost 20 years, including the Civilization and XCOM franchises.

"We are a deeply experienced group of game makers," said Gilmore in a press release, "including many responsible for BioShock’s principal creation, advancement, and longstanding notoriety, and are honored to be part of the 2K family as stewards of this iconic franchise.”

Ken Schachter, who was general manager for Zynga in Toronto and the founder of indie developer/publisher Trapdoor (which co-published Fez and released Warp in 2012), will be the studio manager for the Montréal location.

Earlier this year, 2K also opened up a studio in Silicon Valley, headed by former Sledgehammer Games founders Glenn Schofield and Michael Condrey.

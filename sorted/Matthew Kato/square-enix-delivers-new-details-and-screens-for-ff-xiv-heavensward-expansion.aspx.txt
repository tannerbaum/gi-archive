At the recent Fan Festival event in Japan, Square Enix revealed a few new details about Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn's Heavensward expansion as well as the game's 2.5 patch.
The race is the Au Ra, and they will be joined by two new jobs (the Astrologian/healer role and the Machinist/DPS role), as well as a new raid challenge through the mechanical fortress of Alexander, and a collector's edition.
Screens including the two new jobs are in the gallery below. Astrologians use their star globe and divining deck to support others, while Machinists are adept at long-range weaponry.
The collector's edition includes the game, a dragon figure, art book, disc with trailers and various other videos, and exclusive digital in-game items such as a Cecil-inspired helmet (from FF IV), a kain minion, and a griffin flying mount. The edition's price and availability in North America has not been announced.
Square Enix also detailed patch 2.5 for the game, which includes three new dungeons, triple triad and chocobo racing minigames, and the conclusion of the Crystal Tower raid series.
The Heavensward expansion is due this spring, and the 2.5 patch is TBA.

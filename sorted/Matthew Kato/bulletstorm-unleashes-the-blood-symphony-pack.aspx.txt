  Bulletstorm Unleashes The Blood Symphony Pack






Bulletstorm is all about finding new and interesting ways to kill people, and now the task just got that much more fun with the game's Blood Symphony DLC pack.
The pack is available now on Xbox Live for 800 MS points and $9.99 on PC. A PlayStation Network version will be soon for an as-yet-unannounced price.
Blood Symphony contains the Ultimate Echoes mode, which builds off of the game's Echo mode and requires players to complete certain goals for more bonus points. It also boasts three new multiplayer maps (Mini City, the remains of the Ulysses, and the Rock Quarry) and two Echo maps: Monorail Factory and Mean Street.
Finally, Blood Symphony gives you the Flamingo and Pulp leash variants.

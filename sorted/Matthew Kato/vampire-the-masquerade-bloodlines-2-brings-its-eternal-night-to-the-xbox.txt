  Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 Brings Its Eternal Night To The Xbox Series X






            Vampires are eternal, but the future is now with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 on Xbox Series X (to go along with releases on the current-gen systems and PC).

The system's power should be a good platform for the player's exploration of a large version of a Seattle ruled by rival vampire clans. Players will navigate the world and clan politics in the first-person, taking on missions of all sorts while making choices that shape your experience going forward. Along the way you'll also shape your character from your interaction with the clans, building out your vampire with powers ranging from turning into mist to mind control, as well as more physical attributes.

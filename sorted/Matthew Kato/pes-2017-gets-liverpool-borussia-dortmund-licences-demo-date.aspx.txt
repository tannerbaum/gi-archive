Pro Evolution Soccer 2017


  PES 2017 Gets Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund Licences And Demo Date




Konami has announced a pair of partnerships with top-flight clubs Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund, as well as a date for the upcoming title's demo.
The licenses are not exclusive, although the clubs' official kits and stadiums will be in the title. The latter (Anfield for Liverpool and Signal Iduna Park for Borussia) will be added to the game as part of a free download after the game comes out.)
Liverpool fans will also get to hear the club's anthem, "You'll Never Walk Alone" in the title, as well as play as some Liverpool legends in myClub mode.
The deals with these two clubs seem to be not as "premium" as the one Konami recently signed with super club Barcelona, but they will certainly add touches that fans will appreciate.
Finally, you can get your hands on the game via a demo (PS4/PS3/Xbox One/360) starting on August 23 in North, Central, and South America. The demo features nine teams, including Arsenal and Barcelona, in two stadiums: Camp Nou, and Neu Sonne Arena. You'll also get a 10,000 GP demo bonus for myClub mode.
Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 comes out on September 13 on the above systems as well as PC.

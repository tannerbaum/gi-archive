  2K Sets Next-Gen Retail Price At $69.99 With NBA 2K21






2K has set an example in what is likely to be a new trend by setting the suggested retail price (SRP) of the PlayStation 5/Xbox One version of NBA 2K21 at $69.99. This appears to be the first instance of an upcoming next-gen title listing its price.

The game's press release notes that the game's actual retail price may vary, but barring specific sales retailers typically sell products at the SRP.

We'll have to wait and see if other publishers follow suit now or in the future, but with rising development costs, the power of the coming home consoles, and that this happens every few generations, it's a good bet this is the new normal.

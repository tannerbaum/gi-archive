  Gran Turismo 7 Announced






            Polyphony Digital showed off footage of Gran Turismo 7, with series creator Kazunori Yamauchi highlighting gameplay and promising a compelling campaign mode.

The game did not have a release date, but in-game cockpit footage was shown, as well as a glimpse of the overall game world hub called GT Town. The town included everything from used car shops, the return of the Scapes photo mode feature, a school, multiplayer, and more.

The last Gran Turismo – Gran Turismo Sport – was not a numbered entry, although Polyphony built upon it pretty impressively after release.

            Ace Combat 7 is on the runway for its January 18 launch (PS4, Xbox One. PC on January 31), but before it takes to the skies, publisher/developer Bandai Namco has dropped some intel about the game's multiplayer modes, which include 4v4 and 8-Player play.

The video above not only shows gameplay footage of furious dogfights from the game's 4v4 Team Death Match and 8-Player Battle Royal multiplayer modes, but also gives a sneak peek of the modes' pre- and post-match screens, where you can tweak your loadout and bask in the results.

Selectable aircraft parts include amenities like a machine-gun radar-lock system, the sharp-turn skill, and various pilot bonuses, and the post-match screen reveals that pilots can earn bonus MRP experience for various Performance Evaluation accolades like avoiding the most incoming missiles by using the clouds.

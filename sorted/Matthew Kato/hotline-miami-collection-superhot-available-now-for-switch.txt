  Hotline Miami Collection & Superhot Available Now For Switch






Hotline Miami Collection (featuring the first two games in the series) and Superhot (above)Â are now available for the Switch via the platform's eShop.

Earlier this past weekend, dataminer's found evidence of Superhot for the system, but at least the wait for the title wasn't long at all.

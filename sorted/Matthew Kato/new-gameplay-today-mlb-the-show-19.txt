  New Gameplay Today – MLB The Show 19






            In MLB the Show 19, developer San Diego Studio is attempting to overhaul areas of the series, introducing March to October, a more engaging and dynamic version of the usually no-frills Season mode, as well as introducing Moments – a new way to play through baseball history and make your own.

March to October has you play through pivotal times in a season as your team pushes to get into the playoffs, with the experience changing as you gain and lose momentum during the year.

Meanwhile, Moments tasks you with playing through various real-life scenarios of different sizes, earning rewards throughout the rest of the game's modes.

Game designers Nick Livingston and Ramone Russell stopped by the office to give us a personal tour of the modes, but also dish information on many other aspects of the game, including what’s up with Franchise mode this year, show off gameplay improvements in different areas, and more.

MLB the Show 19 is out exclusively on PlayStation 4 on March 26.

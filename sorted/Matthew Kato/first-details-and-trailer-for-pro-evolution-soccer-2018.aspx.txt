Pro Evolution Soccer 2018


  First Details & Trailer For Pro Evolution Soccer 2018




The Pro Evolution Soccer series looks to take another step on its ascendent trajectory with the release of PES 2018 on September 12 (PS4, Xbox One, PS3, 360, and PC), complete with refined ball control, an online co-op mode, additions to Master League mode, and more.
The franchise has always been lauded for the way dribbling and controlling the ball feels, and PES 2018 hopes to improve on its gameplay through additions such as contextual ball shielding, more subtle player movements via the analog sticks, and the use of various parts of your body to try and control the ball.
In terms of modes, PES 2018 not only introduces 2v2 and 3v3 co-op play (including the ability for local friends to join), but the Master League career mode boasts pre-season tournaments and an improved transfer system. Ambience is added to Master League as well through pre-match interviews and shots of the locker room.
Elsewhere in the game, work continues to be done on the graphics (with in-depth work with license partners such as Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund) – including "a complete rework of the animation system," the return of random selection matches, PES League encompassing more game modes, and Konami's promise of a better PC experience this time around.
For details on the game's various editions and pre-order bonuses across its platforms, head over to the official site.
Also, I'll have some more reaction to these details in an upcoming installment of The Sports Desk. In the meantime, enjoy the teaser trailer below.

  Marvel's Iron Man VR Announced For PlayStation VR






            Sony kicked off its first State of Play presentation with a quick tease for an upcoming Iron Man VR game.

The tease was mostly non-gameplay with Tony Stark in an airplane, but it ended with first-person flying/shooting against a non-descript bad guy. The game will take advantage of two PlayStation Move controllers and Tony will be able to upgrade his tech in his garage.

The game is being developed by Camaflaj, the developer behind RÃ©publique, and it is releasing this year.

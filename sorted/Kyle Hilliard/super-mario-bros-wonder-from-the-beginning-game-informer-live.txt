  Super Mario Bros. Wonder From The Beginning | Game Informer Live






            Super Mario Bros. Wonder is officially out on Switch today and in honor of the occasion, I played through the game's opening hour. I collected a bunch of Wonder flowers, heard Mario's new voice, rode some "marshmallow buffalos", and made it to the first Bowser castle. This is far from our only coverage of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, however. You can find Game Informer's Super Mario Bros. Wonder review here, guides for the Search Party and Flower Coins and Wonder Seeds, and you can even read the full cover story for the game online for free right here.

If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts! Be sure to also follow our second YouTube channel, Game Informer Shows, to watch other Replay episodes as well as Twitch archives such as Replay, GI Live, and more.

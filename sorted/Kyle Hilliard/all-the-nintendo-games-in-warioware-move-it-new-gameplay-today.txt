  All The Nintendo Games In WarioWare: Move It | New Gameplay Today






            A new WarioWare is upon us! And with it comes a whole collection of throwback Nintendo games from the recurring character, 9-Volt. WarioWare: Move It is full of truly surprising games that take advantage of the Switch's unique control options, but it's arguably always the most fun to see what retro Nintendo games make it into any WarioWare collection.

Join Brian Shea and me as we go through all of them and even see what some of the game's look like when played at their second and third tier.

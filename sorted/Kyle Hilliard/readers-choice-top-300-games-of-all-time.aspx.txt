  Reader's Choice Top 300 Games Of All Time






For the 300th issue of Game Informer magazine, we crafted a list of the top 300 games of all time. Despite all the arguing and life-long interpersonal grudges that resulted from the discussions, we had a good time, and we wanted to extend that opportunity to the reader. At the end of February we opened the polls to let readers vote for their favorite games of all time. Readers were able to submit an ordered list of three games. We took those results, weighted them, and the result is the list you will find below! If you think the list is wrong you only have yourselves to blame, but we will happily absorb your criticism in the comment section below!

That's not all! Head to page two from some interesting stat breakdowns, details about the games that didn't make the top 300, and more!

The previous page showcases the list of the top 300 games of all time according to our readers, but the total number of potential games submitted was 880. Here are some of the standout patterns.

Final Fantasy was the most well-represented franchise with 16 games cracking the top 300, but there were 20 on the larger list. The original Final Fantasy, Crystal Chronicles, Type-0 HD, and V were the four that appeared on readers' lists, but didn't make the top 300.

Thirteen games with Mario in the title cracked the top 300, but there were 29 on the larger list. Paper Mario, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Super Mario Bros. 2, Mario Bros., Mario Party, Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart: Double Dash, Super Paper Mario, Dr. Mario, Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Party 7, Super Mario 64 DS, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, Super Mario 3D World, and Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World were among readers' favorite, but were not top 300 material.

Ten Legend of Zelda games cracked the top 300, but there were 15 on the larger list. Link Between Worlds, Majora's Mask 3D, Zelda II, Minish Cap, and Phantom Hourglass were the five that appeared on readers' lists, but didn't make the top 300. Breath of the Wild was the highest, most recently released game to make the list, and Ocarina of Time was the oldest game to reach the highest on the list.

Four Call of Duty games cracked the top 300, but there were nine on the larger list. Big Red One, World at War, Black Ops III and II, and Modern Warfare 3 were the five that appeared on readers' lists, but didn't make the top 300.

Here are some of the oddball choices that stuck out to me as I explored the list. These certainly aren't condemnations of anyone's favorite games – just games I was surprised to see make others' personal top three list.

Pajama Sam: Don't Fear the Dark, Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017), Ghostbusters (1985), and One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird each received one third-place vote.

Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure, Azurik: Rise of Perathia, Roblox each received one second place vote.

Tex Murphy: Overseer, Omikron: The Nomad Soul, No One Can Stop Mr. Domino, and Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs! each received one first place vote.

Thanks to everyone that voted! If you have any issues with the list, please feel free to speak among yourselves!

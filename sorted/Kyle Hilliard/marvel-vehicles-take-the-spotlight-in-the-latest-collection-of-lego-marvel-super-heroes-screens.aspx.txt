  Marvel Vehicles Take The Spotlight In The Latest Collection Of Lego Marvel Super Heroes Screens




They may not be people (or super-people), but the vehicles of the Marvel Universe still serve an important iconic role, and many will be making an appearance in Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
Above, you can see Hulk posing with the X-Men's Blackbird jet. He's leaning near the jet without actually touching it so that he can impress people by convincing them that it's his vehicle with the photo. In the gallery below, you can see more of the recognizable vehicles that will be appearing in the game. So far, TT Games has confirmed that the Cloud Rider (which was designed by 14-year old fan, Thomas), the Deadpool Scooter, the Fantasticar, the Magneto Mobile, the Pumpkin Chopper, and the Spider Copter will all show up.
Lego Marvel Super Heroes is coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and PC on October 22. The game will also be a launch title for both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

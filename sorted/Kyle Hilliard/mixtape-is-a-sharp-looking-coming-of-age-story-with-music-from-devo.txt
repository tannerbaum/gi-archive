  Mixtape Is A Sharp-Looking Coming Of Age Story With Music From Devo, Smashing Pumpkins, And More






            Beethoven & Dinosaur, the developer behind The Artful Escape, revealed its next game during the 2024 Xbox Showcase, and it's all about being a teenager, getting into trouble, listening to music, and apparently flying through the air (though it is likely a metaphor). The trailer, which features an impressive art style and character animation that drops frames à la Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, will feature music from bands like Devo, Roxy Music, Lush, and The Smashing Pumpkins, among others.

  Replay – Monster Rancher






This week on Replay, we, alongside a special guest, take a look at Monster Rancher – a game that turns your CDs into in-game content.
Andrew Reiner, Javy Gwaltney, and I are joined by Motion City Soundtrack frontman Justin Pierre for a look at Reiner's most-played games of all time. We give birth to a handful of monsters, freeze them, and train another, born from Motion City Soundtrack's 2010 album, My Dinosaur Life, into a frozen dinosaur crushing machine. For part two, we look at a game that is perfect for a special rock star guest. Also, Javy wears a chicken hat.

  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Is Coming To Nintendo Switch






            The beloved GameCube RPG, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, is coming to Switch next year. For Switch the game will receive a visual overhaul, but few other details have been offered. The press release for the announcement cites the improved graphics, but otherwise only shares that the game will be coming next year.

I am sure Game Informer reviewed the GameCube version of the game at some point, but that was before my time so I don't know anything about that or any potential controversy that may have resulted.

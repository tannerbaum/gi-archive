  Theme Park And Rollercoaster Simulator Planet Coaster Is Getting A Sequel






            Planet Coaster 2 arrives later this year and its big update, alongside all the rollercoaster and theme park simulation gameplay of the first title, is the inclusion of water park mechanics. You will be able to create water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and more. You will also be able to visit your friend's parks and build together in a shared sandbox mode (though you will apparently have to build one at a time) across platforms. You can check out the announcement trailer below.

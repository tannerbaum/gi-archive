  Nintendo's Super Bowl Ad Has About 1-Second Of New Footage




Nintendo produced a Super Bowl ad for the first time in the company's history, and while it is severely underwhelming it does have a full second of new Zelda: Breath of the Wild footage.
In the very, very short clip (seen in gif form below) Link is shown brandishing his sword in front of Zelda and another character who is taking a nap. Link appears to be protecting both Zelda and the napping character dressed in red, but it's difficult to ascertain much else from the very brief clip.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild launches March 3 on Wii U and Switch, which also releases March 3.

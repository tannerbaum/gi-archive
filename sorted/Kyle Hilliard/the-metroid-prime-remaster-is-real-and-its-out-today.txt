  The Metroid Prime Remaster Is Real And It's Out Today






            The long-rumored Metroid Prime Switch remaster is finally real â€“ and it will be available digitally today. It will be available physically on February 22.

The trailer for the remaster showed off the improved visuals and also noted that the game will be playable with the modern, dual control stick first-person controls. If, however, you would like to play it as originally intended, that will be an option. Nintendo is promising additional control options, as well.

The trailer also reminded that the game takes place on Talon IV, and focuses on using various visors to make progress.

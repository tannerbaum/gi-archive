  Finding The Best Characters In The Concord Beta | GI Live






            Concord is in beta this weekend and Alex Van Aken and I decided to jump in, play a few rounds, and figure out which characters we liked from the impressive roster. Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts "exploding knife!" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.

For a while lot more on Concord, which releases on PlayStation 5 and PC August on August 23, head here to read about how it plays like Destiny meets Overwatch.

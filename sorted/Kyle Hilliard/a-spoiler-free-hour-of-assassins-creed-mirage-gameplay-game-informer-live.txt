  A Spoiler-Free Hour Of Assassin's Creed Mirage Gameplay | Game Informer Live






            Assassin's Creed Mirage – an Assassin's Creed that looks to the original game for primary inspiration – is nearly upon us. Join me as I play not quite the beginning of the game, but one of the game's earlier hours. You get to see some tutorials, a little bit of exploration, and finally, a stealthy attack on a well-guarded dock.

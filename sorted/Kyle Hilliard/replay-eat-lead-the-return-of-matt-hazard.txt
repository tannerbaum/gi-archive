  Replay – Eat Lead: The Return Of Matt Hazard






            Back in 2009, there were fewer funnier games. We didn't have the Trover Saves the Universes and Shakedown: Hawaiis that we do today, but we did have Matt Hazard. He delivered a middling third-person shooter with questionable cover mechanics, but he had Will Arnett's voice and occasionally made us laugh, and we were happy with that.

Today on Replay, Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, Leo Vader, and I decided to revisit the series and play both Matt Hazard games, discuss comedy games, Xbox Live Achievements, and the television show Community for some reason. We also play a third game that I guarantee you will never be able to guess.

For our review of Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard and Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond, follow the links. And for more Replay, come back to this website (or our YouTube channel) in seven days.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

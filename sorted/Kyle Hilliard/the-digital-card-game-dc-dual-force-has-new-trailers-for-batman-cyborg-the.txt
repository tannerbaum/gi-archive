  The Digital Card Game DC Dual Force Has New Trailers For Batman, Cyborg, The Flash, And Harley Quinn






            DC Dual Force, the digital card game based on DC's universe of characters, has entered open beta (you can download it here) which means anyone is free to check out the game. It will also be coming to Steam when it gets its full, official release some time soon, and presumably other platforms. It will also, unsurprisingly, feature some of most popular characters the universe has to offer, including Batman, Harley Quinn, The Flash, and Cyborg, among many, many others. You can check out exclusive trailers for those characters below.

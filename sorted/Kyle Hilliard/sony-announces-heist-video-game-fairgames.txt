            Sony kicked off its 2023 PlayStation Showcase with a new game called Fairgames.

The trailer ended with the tagline take it till you make it and QR code link to taketheir.money.

Little else was offered about the game from the footage shown, but considering the showcase it appeared on, it;s safe to assume it will be releasing in a PlayStation console. The game is being developed by Haven.

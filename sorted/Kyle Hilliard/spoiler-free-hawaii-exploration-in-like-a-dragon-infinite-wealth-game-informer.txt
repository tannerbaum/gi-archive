  Spoiler-Free Hawaii Exploration In Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth | Game Informer Live






            Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth release tomorrow, and ahead of the launch, Marcus Stewart and I decided to cause some trouble in the streets of Hawaii. Check out the archive of our stream below where we chat about the series, whether or not this is a good place to jump in, and just generally talk about what makes the game cool without spoiling any story elements. It's just some good old fashion beating up random people on the streets in Ichiban and pals.

You can read Game Informer's Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review by following the link, and learn why the game feels like an RPG for grown-ups in unexpected ways.

  Undermine 2 | New Gameplay Today Exclusive






            The original Undermine released in 2020 and was an unexpected rogue hit that felt like it came out of nowhere. We had a chance to speak with developer Thorium about some of the changes for the sequel, and got to play a portion of the game, as well. Join Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart for a look at new, exclusive gameplay, and a discussion about what makes the Undermine games so special.

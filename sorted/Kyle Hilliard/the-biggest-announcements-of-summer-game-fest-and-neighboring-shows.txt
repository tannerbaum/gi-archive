  The Biggest Announcements Of Summer Game Fest And Neighboring Shows






            E3 is no more, but in its place a new different kind of summer video game show has emerged. It's Summer Game Fest... and friends? Geoff Keighley's show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend. Enjoy!

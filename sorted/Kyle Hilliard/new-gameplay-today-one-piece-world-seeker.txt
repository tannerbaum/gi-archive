  New Gameplay Today â€“ One Piece: World Seeker






            The One Piece franchise has had its fair share of video game adaptations covering action games, fighting games, and more but One Piece: World Seeker is easily the most ambitious of the bunch. It's an open-world game in the truest sense giving you a full island to explore using Luffy's stretching abilities. There are also plenty of Marines and pirates to beat up, too.

Join Ben Hanson, intern Jason Guisao, and me as we zip around the world, pick fights, and learn all about Jason's favorite anime.

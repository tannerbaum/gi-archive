  Mario & Luigi: Brothership Is An RPG Releasing Later This Year






            Nintendo kicked off its June 2024 Nintendo Direct presentation with the surprise reveal of a new Mario & Luigi game. This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a "seafaring adventure" that will include new evolved "Bros moves".

The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.

  Gears Of War: Judgment Goes Gold






According to the official Gears of War: Judgment Facebook page, the game has gone gold and will soon be ready for consumer consumption! Seen above is the development staff celebrating their victory.
For those unfamiliar with the term, going gold basically means the game is ready for mass printing. It means all the development on the game is complete, and now they just need to place it on a couple hundred-thousand discs.
Gears of War: Judgment releases March 19, for Xbox 360.

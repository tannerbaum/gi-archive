  One Punch Man: World | New Gameplay Today






            One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.

One Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.

The second chapter of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is finally coming to North America next year. Titled The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC, it will pick up where the first game left off.
The original game released for PSP back in 2011. You can read our review of the game here, which is positive, but makes mention of the incomplete story.
The game will be available as a digital download for the PSP (which also makes it playable on the Vita), and PC. The original The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky will also be made available on PC in advance of the second chapter.
You can check out the teaser trailer for the game below.

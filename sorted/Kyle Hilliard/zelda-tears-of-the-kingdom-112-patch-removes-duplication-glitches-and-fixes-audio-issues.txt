  Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom 1.1.2 Patch Removes Duplication Glitches And Fixes Audio Issues






            Zelda received its second post-release patch last night, and just like its first post-release update, the patch notes cover a lot of ground without diving into many specifics.

Here are the patch notes from Nintendo's website:

Ver. 1.1.2 (Released May 25, 2023)
Audio Bug Fixes
     • Fixed an issue where the sound would play at an extremely high volume in certain conditions.

Additional Fixes
     • Fixed an issue in the main quest, “Camera Work in the Depths”, where players could not progress beyond a certain point. Downloading the update will allow players to proceed past that point.
     • Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.

Alongside fixing the audio issue and the Camera Work in the Depths quest, the "Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience," note is covering a lot of ground. It seems most if not all of the duplication glitches players discovered, which allowed them to duplicate rare items in the game with suprisingly little effort, have effectively been removed from the game, according to posters on the r/NintendoSwitch subreddit.

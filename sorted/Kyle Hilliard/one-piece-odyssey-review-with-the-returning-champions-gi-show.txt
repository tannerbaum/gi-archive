  One Piece Odyssey Review With The Returning Champions | GI Show






            Your regular host, Alex Van Aken, is out on a mysterious project this week so guest host Kyle Hilliard is back to throw out the format and talk entirely too much about anime. The discussion is timely, though, as the big release of the week is One Piece Odyssey, Bandai Namco's impressive RPG based on the popular anime. John Carson, who is reviewing the game for Game Informer, returns to talk about his experience and share his favorite games of 2022. We are also joined by former Game Informer editor and former host of this very podcast, Benjamin Reeves! Reeves makes his triumphant return to The Game Informer Show to also share his favorite games of 2022 and, alongside Wesley LeBlanc, reveal just how little they know about One Piece with our Devil Fruit quiz.

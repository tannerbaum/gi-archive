Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward


  Here's Heavensward's Opening Cinematic




Square Enix has released the opening cinematic for Final Fantasy XIV's upcoming expansion, Heavensward.
You can check out the cinematic below which, fair warning, contains 
some scenes from the ending of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn's main 
story, so look out for spoilers if you're trying to avoid them. 
Unsurprisingly, it looks great, living up to Square Enix's long-ago 
established standard of quality for pre-rendered cutscenes.
Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward launches June 23 on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 3.

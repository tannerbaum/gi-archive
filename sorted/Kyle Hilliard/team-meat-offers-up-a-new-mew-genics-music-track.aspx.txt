Team Meat has been consistent with its "Caturday" updates, revealing new details about its upcoming game, Mew-Genics, every week. This week, Team Meat has posted a new music track from the game.
The track is called "Dirty Mittens" and is one of 12 "jukebox" tracks from the game. The music will apparently change, speed up, and slow down depending on the weather appearing in the game. You can download "Dirty Mittens" as well as the previously released track, "The Ballad of D. Claude" on the official Band Camp page for the game's soundtrack.

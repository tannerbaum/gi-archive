  New Gameplay Today â€“ Spider-Man's The Heist DLC






            Spider-Man is getting its first DLC tomorrow. The Heist is the first of three planned DLC additions, which is all part of The City that Never Sleeps initiative. The Heist follows the exploits of Black Cat and picks up, surprisingly, where the main game's story left off. It's not so much a side-story as it is a follow-up, which makes it very exciting! If you haven't beaten the main game, by the way, beware of spoilers! as we play through the opening few minutes.

Our TakeI particularly like Sekiro, especially compared to From Software's other games, so I am glad to see it doing well. The question now is, does From roll into Sekiro 2? Or has it already started on Bloodborne 2 or Dark Souls 4? Or maybe it is tackling something completely new? I'm curious to see what is next and whether it will be sticking with Activision as a publisher.

  Replay – Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time






In 2003, Ubisoft joined forces with Prince of Persia's original creator, Jordan Mechner, to reboot the series – and it was highly successful.
A precursor to Assassin's Creed (Patrice Désilets was the creative director on Sands of Time, the original Assassin's Creed, and its sequel), Sands of Time provided the groundwork for the navigation and parkour moves that are now staples of Ubisoft's biggest franchise. I recently wrote about my appreciate for the game extensively in one of our weekly Essentials features, which you can read here.
In our second segment we tackle a Prince of Persia game you may not be familiar with, even if you've been following the series.

  [Update] God Of War III Director Leaves Sony Santa Monica






Update: Sony has offered a brief, but clear statement on Stig Asmussen's status with Sony Santa Monica.
A representative from Sony offered the following statement confirming Asmussen's departure from Sony Santa Monica saying, "SCEA can confirm that Stig Asmussen is no longer with Santa Monica Studio."

Original story:
Stig Asmussen, a developer with Sony Santa Monica and the God of War series, and director on God of War III (and star of this commercial), has reportedly left the studio.
IGN received confirmation from anonymous sources that Asmussen recently left. Asmussen was not involved with the recent God of War: Ascension, and was apparently working on an internal project unrelated to the God of War franchise.

Our TakeIf these reports are true, then it adds to a a list that is grown oddly large this week of known developers leaving their studios. Konami's Koji Igarashi, Sucker Punch's Jaime Griesemer, and Microsoft's Marc Whitten (who is admittedly not a developer, but rather was involved in the industry as an executive), all left their studios and companies recently. The video game industry is changing at a surprising pace.

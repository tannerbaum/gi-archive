  New Exclusive Dementium II Behind The Scenes Video Looks At The Sound Design




Dementium II released on DS in 2010, and developer Memetic Games is updating the game for PC and Mac. The latest exclusive behind the scenes video looks at the game's sound design.
Much like the artists and designers for the game, sound director Morné Marais has to deal with the problems that come along with building a horror game with mindless, terrifying monsters. You can check out the first and second behind the scenes videos by following the links.
Dementium II is coming to PC and Mac on December 17. The game is currently accepting pre-orders on Steam at 35% percent discount.

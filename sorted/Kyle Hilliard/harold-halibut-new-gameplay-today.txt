  Harold Halibut | New Gameplay Today






            Harold Halibut has been in development for more than a decade. It has a fascinating and unique style set in a well-realized future where a portion of humanity has relocated to an underwater planet. It's a bit like Interstellar, but if things had gone how they were supposed to. Ahead of the game's release on April 16 (on Game Pass as well as other platforms), Charles Harte and I decided to take a look at an early portion of the game, discuss the developers' intentions for the narrative and gameplay, and detail how the game was made.

For a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu.

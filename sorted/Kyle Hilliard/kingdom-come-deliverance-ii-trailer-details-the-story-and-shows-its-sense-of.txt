  Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Trailer Details The Story And Shows Its Sense Of Humor






            We learned Kingdom Come: Deliverance II would be coming soon earlier this year, but Summer Game Fest offered us our first substantial look at the game and its story. It will follow a pair of chaotic brothers as the cause shenanigans in the medieval era. The trailer showed a surprising amount of comedy.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, but developer Warhorse Studios has not offered a release date yet.

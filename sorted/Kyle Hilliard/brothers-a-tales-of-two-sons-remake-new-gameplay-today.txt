  Brothers: A Tales Of Two Sons Remake | New Gameplay Today






            In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.

Now, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.

  Segway Showdown: Final Fantasy VII Vs. Like A Dragon






            Both Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth inexplicably feature Segway-inspired scooters. We don't know why this happened, or if developers at Square Enix and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio were in communication, or if scooters happen to be really popular in Japan right now – we don't know. One question we can answer, however, is which one is better?

Join Marcus Stewart and me as we put the two Segway-inspired scooters to the test side-by-side across a series of competitions and stunts to see which two-wheeled balancing vehicle is the best.

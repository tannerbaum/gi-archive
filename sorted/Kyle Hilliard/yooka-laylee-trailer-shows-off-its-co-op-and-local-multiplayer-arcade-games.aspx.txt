Yooka-Laylee


  New Trailer Shows Off Its Co-op And Local Multiplayer Arcade Games




Yooka-Laylee is a single-player platformer, inspired by the mascot platformers of the past, but it will offer some opportunities for multiplayer play.
In the Rextro's Arcade, players can unlock games like Glaciators, Kartos Karting, Blag the Flag, Gun-let Run, Jobstacle Course, Hurdle Hijinx, and more with another player. The trailer also shows off the game's co-op where a second player, the Bee Team, can grab quills and collect butterflies, stop some traps, and help the lead player clear certain obstacles.

Yooka-Laylee releases on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC April 11. Yooka-Laylee has also been announced for Nintendo Switch. To see the game in action, head here.

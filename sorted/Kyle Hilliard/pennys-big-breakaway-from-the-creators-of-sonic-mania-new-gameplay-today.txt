  Penny's Big Breakaway From The Creators Of Sonic Mania | New Gameplay Today






            Following the release of Sonic Mania (and its various follow-up versions), director Christian Whitehead and friends decided to start developer Evening Star to do one of the most difficult things in video games: create a brand new original property. Penny's Big Breakaway is a new character in a unique platformer and we had a chance to go hands on with it ahead of its release next year.

Join Game Informer's Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard as they play a few levels and discuss what's potentially cool about the game. And also make sure to keep an eye out for the latest issue of Game Informer magazine where you can find a big feature on the game alongside interviews with its creator.

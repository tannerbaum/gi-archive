  Video Recap - Sony's E3 2013 Press Conference






Immediately after Sony delivered its press conference, we gathered a few editors on camera to talk about the impressive news Sony delivered.
No used restrictions, no required online check-in, and a price tag $100 cheaper than the PlayStation 4's main competitor, the Xbox One. Check out the video below to hear Mike Futter, Matt Helgeson, and Jeff Marchiafava discuss one of the best press conferences we've seen in a long time.

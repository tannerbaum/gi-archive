In the latest 'Cat-urday' update for Team Meat's upcoming Mew-Genics, we learn about breeding cats, and see some gameplay in gif form.
You can check out the gif below, which shows the birthing process. As Mew-Genics co-creator Edmund McMillen points out on the Mew-Genics blog, the baby has the head-shape of the father (the white cat) and the spotted appearance of the mother.

McMillen also shared a screenshot form the game, which you can see at the top of this page, where he was able to selectively breed a cat covered entirely in the brick pattern. Apparently, that cat's grandmother only had the brick pattern on her tail.
On today's update McMillen also published an activity page where you have to match the right poop to the right cat. You can head here to print it out.

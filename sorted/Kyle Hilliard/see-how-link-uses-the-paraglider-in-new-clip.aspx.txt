The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild


  See How Link Uses The Paraglider In New Clip




It's not necessarily new or revelatory footage of Breath of the Wild, but it's nice to see more of the game in action.
Nintendo recently tweeted out a short clip of Link using the paraglider. We've seen plenty of Link using the paraglider during the game's E3 presentation, but this footage does show off some neat tricks, like Link using a fire arrow to light up a patch of dry grass to create a current to lift him higher. It's very, very slick.

You can find another Breath of the Wild clip here, which shows off a dilapidated Temple of Time. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is coming to Wii U and Nintendo's not-yet-officially named NX console next year.

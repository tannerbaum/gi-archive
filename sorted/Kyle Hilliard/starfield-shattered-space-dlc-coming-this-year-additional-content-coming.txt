  Starfield Shattered Space DLC Coming This Year, Additional Content Coming Today






            Starfield is getting a big expansion later this year, but you will also be able to play with some new content later tonight. The big expansion is called Shattered Space and appears to put you in conflict with the cultish organization, The Serpent's Embrace. It looks very creepy.

We're not sure when Shattered Space is releasing (outside of 2024) , but there will be some content available tonight. New locations, new gear, new bounties, and all kinds of new custom content will all be available to play soon.

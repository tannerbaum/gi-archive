  Team Meat Reveals New Characters For Mew-Genics




Platform

Publisher

Release
2024

During Team Meat's myriad updates for Mew-Genics, we've learned a lot about its assorted characters and personalities. Yesterday, Team Mean revealed there are more side-characters that will appear in the game.
Every day of the week you play Mew-Genics, you will have the opportunity to meet one of these side characters. In Team Meat co-founder Edmund McMillen's latest update, he says you will only know some of these characters from written letters, while some will appear in person making requests, or offering you something.
McMillen also wrote and drew a new comic for this week's update detailing characters Tink and Butch. You can see it by heading here. Finally, McMillen says the reason he hasn't been keeping up with his weekly "Caturday" updates the last few weeks is because he and development partner Tommy Refenes have been hard at work on the game, and Refenes has developed a new way of simulating cat AI, which will be detailed in a future update.
We've learned a lot about Mew-Genics since its original announcement. You can read all of our updates by following links here (trailer), here (details on birthing and breeding cats), here (details on cat disease), here (music from the Mew-Genics soundtrack), here (more music and an FAQ), and here (details on the game's collectible furniture).
Mew-Genics is coming to PC and iOS devices some time this year.

  Dragon's Dogma | Replay






            Dragon's Dogma 2, the long-demanded sequel to the cult fantasy RPG, is finally coming next week. In honor of the event, Wesley LeBlanc and I decided to look back on the first game and try and figure out what makes it special.

For a whole lot more on Dragon's Dogma 2, you can head here to see the latest trailer, read about its uncapped framerate here, and plan your weekend by learning about how long the sequel will be. You can find all of our Dragon's Dogma 2 content right here.

Nightdive Studios, the developer behind the upcoming remaster of System Shock, released some new gameplay footage today showing off the game with its new engine.
Originally announced being developed with Unity, the developer switched over to Unreal, according to an interview with Polygon. Game director Jason Fader told Polygon, “Unity is not a great engine to use if you want to make an FPS on console.” The footage below represents an early version of the game which is still subject to change, but it shows off some impressive visuals for the classic shooter.

  Rumor: Next Gears Of War To Be A Prequel






It's all strictly rumor, but according to the upcoming issue of Official Xbox Magazine, the next Gears of War game could be a prequel, and it could be in the hands of developer People Can Fly.
People Can Fly was recently acquired by Epic Games. Its first game Bulletstorm was published by the Gears of War developer, so a partnership like this seems very likely. The Gears of War team is probably ready for something new after finishing Gears of War 3, but the franchise is still incredibly popular, so it would be a shame to not keep updating the series with new games.
In the meantime, Epic is still hard at work on Gears with new DLC, RAAM's Shadow, coming December 13.
What do you think? Do you think developer People Can Fly is a good fit for the Gears of War universe?

  Alan Wake 2 Night Springs Expansion Releases Tomorrow, Physical Version Of The Game Coming Soon






            Alan Wake 2 is getting DLC tomorrow, June 8, called Night Springs that follows familiar characters from the Alan Wake universe in three "what if" scenarios.

One "episode" follows Rose Marigold from the diner, Alan Wake's biggest fan, who feels she is the only one capable of saving him. Another episode follows Shawn Ashmore where he appears to be playing himself as opposed to his character, Sheriff Tim Breaker. Of course, this is Alan Wake, so who knows where the fourth wall line exists. Finally, a third episode follows Jesse Faden from Remedy's previous game, Control.

Alongside the DLC, game director Sam Lake took the Summer Game Fest stage to announce that a phsyical verison of the game is finally on the way, as well, and pre-orders open tomorrow. You can read our Alan Wake 2 review here.

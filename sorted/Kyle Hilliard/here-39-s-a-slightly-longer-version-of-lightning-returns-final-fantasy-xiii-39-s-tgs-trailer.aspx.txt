The extended version of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII's TGS trailer showcases longer cuts of the footage we saw last week, and gives Snow some screen time.
There are also a few new characters and some extra gameplay, but overall, there isn't much you haven't already seen if you've been keeping up with Lightning's return.
You can head here to see the shorter trailer of the one below, and here to see Lightning in Yuna's Final Fantasy X Summoner dress.

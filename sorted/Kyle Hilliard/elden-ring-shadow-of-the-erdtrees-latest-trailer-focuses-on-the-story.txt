  Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree's Latest Trailer Focuses On The Story






            The latest trailer for the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC focuses on how the add-on will fit into the story of Elden Ring. The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.

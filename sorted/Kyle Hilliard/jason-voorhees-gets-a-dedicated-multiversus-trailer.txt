  Jason Voorhees Gets A Dedicated MultiVersus Trailer






            Jason, alongside Agent Smith from The Matrix, had a cameo in the last MultiVersus trailer, but now he is the star. The footage shows off his moveset, like hitting opponents with a machete, collapsing them in a camp bunk bed, and hitting them with a sleeping bag stuffed with the body of another player. You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.

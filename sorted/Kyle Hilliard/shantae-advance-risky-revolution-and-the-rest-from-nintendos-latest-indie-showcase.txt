  Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution And The Rest From Nintendo's Latest Indie Showcase






            Nintendo shared its latest Indie World showcase this morning and has become typical with these showcases, we learned about a number of new exciting indie games coming to Switch and Switch first, as well as some hit already-released games that will be making their way to Nintendo's platform.

Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution was arguably the most interesting title. Developer WayForward began development on the game 20 years ago, but never completed it. Next year, the game will finally make its way to Switch, but retain the Game Boy Advance aesthetic it was always meant to have.

Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition is bringing the excellent space-exploring mystery game to the handheld console and will include the Echoes of the Eye expansion. The game releases December 7 and a physical version of the game is planned.

On Your Tail from Memorable Games and Humble Games is coming to Switch first next year and is a mystery adventure starring anthropomorphic animals.

A Highland Song is a beautiful narrative platfomer taking place in the Scottish Highlands. The game will also apparently include some rhythm elements. The game will be available December 5 on Switch.

Popular PC indie titles Backpack Hero and Core Keeper are both making their way to Switch. The former is available today and Core Keeper arrives summer 2024.

Howl from Mi’pu’mi Games and astragon Entertainment has a style reminiscent of Cartoon Saloon's films like Wolfwalkers. In the game, a plague from the howling wolves is causing havoc and you, as a deaf prophet, must fight against it.

Blade Chimera is a platformer seemingly inspired by games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but takes place in the future and features a time-bending sword. Blade Chimera will come to Switch as a timed-exclusive spring 2024.

Death Trick: Double Blind is a new mystery game that takes place in a circus starring a magician and an amnesiac detective. The game will be available later today.

The Star Named EOS is a storytelling puzzle adventure where you must take photos to trace the footsteps of your missing mother. The game will be available spring 2024.

Raw Fury has had a good 2023 and that trend seems to be continuing with Moonstone Island. The game is a deck-building, animal collecting, cozy game with some procedural generation elements. The game will be a timed-exclusive for Switch in Spring 2024.

Along with those games receiving highlight, Nintendo also shared a number of other announcements related to indie games. Planet of Lana launched spring 2024 on Switch. Enjoy the Diner will be available later today. The Gecko Gods is coming to Switch spring 2024. Passpartout 2: The Lost Artist, the painting adventure game will be available on Switch today.

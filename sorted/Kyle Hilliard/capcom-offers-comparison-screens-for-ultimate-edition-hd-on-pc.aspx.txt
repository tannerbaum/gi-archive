Resident Evil 4 is coming to Steam updated with high-definition textures and Capcom released a handful of screens showcasing the differences.
Some of the differences are slight, not dramatically changing the visuals of the game, but some of the changes are far more apparent, like the text on the grenades. You can check out the full collection of comparison images in the gallery below or on Capcom's blog.
The new PC version of Resident Evil 4 is coming February 28. Along with the updated textures and characters, the game will run at 60 frames-per-second (a hot topic right now in the video game industry), and has been optimized for widescreens. If you pre-order the game, by heading here, you'll also get your hands on the game's soundtrack and a digital artbook.

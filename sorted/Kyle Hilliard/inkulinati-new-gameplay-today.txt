  Inkulinati | New Gameplay Today






            In Inkulinati, you play a strategy game on the pages of medieval manuscripts. The game was originally announced in 2020 (before Pentiment) and we took a look at it earlier this year. Now, however, we had a chance to go hands-on. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard for a look at this unique game that is surprisingly reliant on the tactical power of farts.

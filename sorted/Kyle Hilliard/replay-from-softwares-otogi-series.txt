  Replay – From Software's Otogi Series






            From Software is known predominantly for the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and the recent Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, but back in 2003, before Hidetaka Miyazaki had joined the developer, it released a pair of action games exclusively for the Xbox called Otogi: Myth of Demons and Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors. The two games share some overlap with From's latest game, Sekiro, in that they're third-person action games starring protagonists who exist between life and death and they take place in heightened versions of Japanese history.

Join Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, Leo Vader, and me as we play the beginning of each game, revisit some smart Tenchu jokes, and die admittedly more than we like. It is a From Software game, after all.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

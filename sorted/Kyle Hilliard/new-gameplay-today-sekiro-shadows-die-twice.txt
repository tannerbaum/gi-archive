  New Gameplay Today – Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice






            Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is clearly made by the studio that created Dark Souls and Bloodborne, but it stands on its own thanks to a bevy of new mechanics and a jump button.

Ahead of our review (which is coming soon!), join us for a substantial look at the game as Dan Tack, Jeff Marchiafava, and I play through the first hour and 40 minutes. You will see some early game spoilers and bosses, but a large majority of the game remains spoiler-free – we promise.

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 22. For a whole lot more on Sekiro, check out all of the feature from when then game was on our cover by clicking the banner below.

We've been "surfing" in Pokémon for years, but it in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, you will finally be able to do the real thing.
The latest trailer for the game reveals all kinds of new details, like the return of Island Challenges, a new trial for Mina, and the appearance of at least 400 Pokémon in the game. The trailer also details the Alola Photo Club, which we revealed back in August with the game's director. The best (possibly) however, was saved for last with the reveal of legitimate, honest to god surfing. In the game, you will be able to surf between islands on the back of Mantine while pulling off an assortment of fancy tricks.

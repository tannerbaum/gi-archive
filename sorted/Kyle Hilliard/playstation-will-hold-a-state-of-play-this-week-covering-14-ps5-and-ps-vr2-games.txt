            Sony has announced its intentions to hold a State of Play broadcast this week that will last for a little over 30 minutes and feature updates on 14 PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR2 games with a specific focus on PlayStation Studios titles arriving later this year.

State of Play returns with a 30+ minute broadcast this Thursday at 3pm PT / 11pm BST: https://t.co/eJWbP09sv3

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.

At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.

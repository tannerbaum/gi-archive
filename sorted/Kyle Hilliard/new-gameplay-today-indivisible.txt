  New Gameplay Today â€“ Indivisible






            During PAX West 2018, both Dan Tack and I got a chance to play Indivisible from Lab Zero Games, and we walked away impressed. To explain why we were impressed, we convinced New Gameplay Today co-hosts Jeff Cork and Leo Vader to let us on their show so we could talk at them about why the game seems cool. It's an RPG that bypasses all the pesky menu navigation usually affiliated with the genre, and makes it a solid, well-animated platformer when you're not beating up bad guys.

Indivisible is set for release sometime next year.

  Stellar Blade | New Gameplay Today






            Ahead of Stellar Blade's launch on PlayStation 5 on April 26, a demo for the game will be made available that lets players play through approximately the game's opening hour. And ahead of the demo's release on Friday, March 29, we got to go hands-on with it early. Join Marcus Stewart and me for a look at the game's combat, boss fights, traversal, visuals, and more.

And for a whole lot more on Stellar Blade, you can read this feature where I spoke with Stellar Blade’s game director, Hyung-Tae Kim, and its technical director, Dong-Gi Lee, about the game's development, how the team was inspired by Nier: Automata, and why it wanted to make a game with an ending.

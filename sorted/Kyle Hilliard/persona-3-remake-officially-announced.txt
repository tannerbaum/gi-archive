  Persona 3 Remake Officially Announced






            After an accidental early posting earlier this week on Atlus' official Instagram accounts, the remake of Persona 3 is officially real.

The Persona 3 remake is called Persona 3 Reload and is being made in Unreal Engine. The footage of the game points to it being a total, from-the-ground-up remake, which might explain why the recent re-release of Persona 3 on modern platforms was somewhat underwhelming. The game is set to release in early 2024 and will be available on Xbox Game Pass.

It's "Caturday," which means Team Meat has a new update for Mew-Genics. Today, it's all about furniture and Animal Crossing.
Furniture is a new feature that has been added to Mew-Genics recently, and Team Meat is hoping it scratches the same collection itch that inspires players to keep returning to Animal Crossing. Different furniture and where it is placed affects different statistics in a multitude of ways. There are a planned 750 pieces of furniture of assorted sizes, with alternate rare pieces that increase the number of furniture pieces even further.
You can check out the official Mew-Genics website for the full update, and if you're still unclear what exactly the next game from the makers of Super Meat Boy is (and you're not alone), a helpful FAQ was posted recently answering some common questions about the game.

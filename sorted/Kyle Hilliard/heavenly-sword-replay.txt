  Heavenly Sword | Replay






            Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory's foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

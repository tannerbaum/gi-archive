  Replay – God Of War III






            Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is on our cover this month and it's a game that is being directed by Stig Asmussen. Before joining the Star Wars universe, Asmussen worked on another franchise that took place a long time ago when he directed God of War III.

This week on Replay Andrew Reiner, Suriel Vazquez, Leo Vader, and I try to recover from E3 by reminiscing about the final entry in the God of War trilogy and talk about its connections to Jedi: Fallen Order.

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

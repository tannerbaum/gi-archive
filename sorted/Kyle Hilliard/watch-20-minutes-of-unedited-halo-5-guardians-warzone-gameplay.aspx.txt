  Watch 20 Minutes Of Unedited Halo 5: Guardians Warzone Gameplay






Warzone is Halo 5's newest multiplayer pillar, offering large battles with A.I. opponents jumping into the mix, and we have a uncut video of a full match.
You can check out the video below, which is totally unedited. You will see the loading screens as well as the intermittent successes and frequent undeniable failures of my first time playing the mode. I was confused at times, confident at others, and deadliest when I got my hands on a rocket launcher. Please be nice in the comments, and enjoy the full playthrough.
Sorry, this video is not available

  Humanity | New Gameplay Today






            Humanity is a new puzzle game from the same publisher as Tetris Effect. In the game you, as a dog, must direct an endless stream of humans as they mindlessly walk forward. It's up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that's what the game is about.

As a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it's nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.

For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Afterimage, Crash Team Rumble, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Exoprimal, Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, and more.

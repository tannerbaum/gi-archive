  An Into The Spider-Verse Costume And More Are Coming To Spider-Man 2 Later This Month






            Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.

A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."

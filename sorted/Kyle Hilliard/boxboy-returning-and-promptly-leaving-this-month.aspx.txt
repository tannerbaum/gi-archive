Bye-Bye BoxBoy


  BoxBoy Returning And Promptly Leaving This Month




BoxBoy, Nintendo's charming little puzzle platformer from the creators of Kirby is getting a third, and possibly final, entry.
The game, which Nintendo's tweet defines as the third game in the trilogy, released in Japan in February and even received an accompanying amiibo. The English version of the game will be available on March 23 for 3DS. It's currently unclear if we will also be getting the amiibo.

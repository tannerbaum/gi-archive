It's been awhile since we've heard new details about Mew-Genics from 
Team Meat, creators of Super Meat Boy, but today a new informational comic appeared on the game's official site.
In
 the latest update on the site, the artist half of Team Meat, Edmund 
McMillen, tries to alleviate one of the biggest hurdles of Mew-Genics. 
"The biggest issue we seem to be having with Mew-Genics is explaining 
what the hell it is. "WHAT IS MEW-GENICS?" "HOW DOES IT PLAY?!" are by 
far the most common questions we get these days... and it's honestly not
 easy to answer," McMillen says. To help with these questions, McMillen put together a comic, which you can read here.
In the comic, various previously revealed characters detail what they think Mew-Genics is about. One thinks it's about genetic experimentation, another thinks it's about Pok√©mon-style animal combat, another says racing, while another says the game is about cat beauty pageants.
Team Meat says more details should be showing up next year, including some gameplay footage. "All in all Mew-Genics is currently the biggest project Tommy [Refenes] and I have 
ever worked on, and we are both going all in on a game genre we aren't 
even sure exists... " McMillen says.
Mew-Genics is coming to PC and iOS devices. For more on Mew-Genics, check out some of our previous coverage here, here, here, and here.

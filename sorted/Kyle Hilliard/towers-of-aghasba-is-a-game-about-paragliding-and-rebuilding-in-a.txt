  Towers Of Aghasba Is A Game About Paragliding And Rebuilding In A Mysterious Alien World






            During PlayStation's 2023 Showcase Sony showed Towers Of Aghasba â€“ a game about rebuilding a strange alien world. The admittedly early footage from the game shows a character rebuilding a town, gliding through the air on a paraglider, riding and fighting strange creatures, and collecting resources. The trailer also showed flying whales in the sky.

Towers Of Aghasba comes from Dreamlit and appears to be taking ample inspiration from Breath of the Wild and should be arriving next year.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Donut County






            In Donut County you play as a mobile hole in the ground that expands as it eats new objects in the environment so that it can eat larger objects. Eventually, you get big enough to eat up entire buildings. The initial idea for the game actually came from the parody Peter Molyneux twitter account, Peter Molydeux, and developer Ben Esposito expanded into a full experience.

To show off the game I joined Jeff Cork and Leo Vader to show off a few levels. For more on Donut County, you can read our review right here.

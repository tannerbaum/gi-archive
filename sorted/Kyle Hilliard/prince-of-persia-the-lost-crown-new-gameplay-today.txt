  Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown | New Gameplay Today






            We recently got a chance to play the first three hours of the upcoming Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and chat with the developer Ubisoft Montpellier about the game's development. You can find our full written feature on the game in the most recent issue of Game Informer magazine, but for a taste of all we learned about the game, join Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart for a look at the game's opening, first boss, and few sections from later in the game.

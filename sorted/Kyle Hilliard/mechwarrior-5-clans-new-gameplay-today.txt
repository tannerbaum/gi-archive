  MechWarrior 5: Clans | New Gameplay Today






            MechWarrior is a video game series that has been going strong since 1989, and was even a tabletop wargame before that. Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe's fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.

Join Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.

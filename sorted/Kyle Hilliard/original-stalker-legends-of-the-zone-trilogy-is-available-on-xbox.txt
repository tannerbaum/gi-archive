  Original Stalker: Legends Of The Zone Trilogy Is Available On Xbox Today






            The classic PC shooter Stalker (often stylized as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.), is now available on Xbox starting today. The game's official title is Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy and includes the base game Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat. For those who never played the original games, this is a great way to prepare before the launch of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which will be on Game Pass on September 5, 2024.

   Answering Spider-Man's Lingering Questions






All month long we've been sharing features covering Spider-Man, along with going in-depth on the game in the magazine's cover story. To close things out for the month, we opened the doors to the community (and a person dressed as Captain America, for some reason) to give us questions for the game's creative director, Bryan Intihar. We weren't able to ask every question we received, and skipped the ones that ventured into spoiler territory, but we want to thank everyone that submitted questions. We hope you enjoy the answers!

You can watch the interview with Intihar below, subscribe and listen to the audio on iTunes or Google Play, or listen on SoundCloud.

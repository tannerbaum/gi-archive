  Alone In the Dark, The Remake Of The Original Survival Horror Game | New Gameplay Today






            The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark's upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It's a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.

Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark's chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

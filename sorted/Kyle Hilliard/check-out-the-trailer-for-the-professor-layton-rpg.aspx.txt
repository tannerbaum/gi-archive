Professor Layton and the Last Specter


  Check Out The Trailer For The Professor Layton RPG




Included as a bonus with the upcoming game Professor Layton and the Last Specter for the Nintendo DS is a full RPG called Professor Layton's London Life. Here is the first trailer showing off a few details of the game, and the very cool, very retro art style. It reminds me of Earthbound, which is always a good thing.
It looks like you won't be playing as the Professor in the RPG, but rather creating and customizing your own character with which to explore London. If this looks totally uninteresting to you and you just want to play a traditional Layton game, don't worry. The Last Specter is all the things you know and love about Layton. This supposedly 100-hour game is included as a bonus. I like to think of it as an apology for the long period of turnover between this game releasing in Japan, and making its way here to North America.Professor Layton and the Last Specter and the Included RPG, Professor Layton's London Life, will be sold together and will be releasing on October 17.

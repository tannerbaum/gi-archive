  Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time | Replay






            This week on Replay, in honor of the recently released Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, we decided to go back and take a look at Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. This entry in the series is from far from the first Prince of Persia game, but it represented a reboot of sorts and has become the game most identified with the franchise. It also is undeniably important to what would eventually become Assassin's Creed.

Join superfan Kyle Hilliard and Prince of Persia newcomer Wesley LeBlanc for a look at the 2003 classic. This isn't the first time we've revisited Ubisoft's classic platformer. You can watch our original Replay episode on Sands of Time from 2015 here.

  New Gameplay Today â€“ Below With Creative Director Kris Piotrowski






            Originally announced on Microsoft's E3 2013 stage, Below has had a strange development path. At a certain point, it publicly went dark receiving an indefinite delay. It was even fair to assume the game was unofficially cancelled, but the game is still very much alive, and coming very soon.

To assure us the game exists and that it still looks great, creative director Kris Piotrowski brought the game by our offices, played through the opening moments, and even jumped to a point a little later in the game to show us what Below is all about and touch on why the game has been in development for so long.

  Gunbrella | New Gameplay Today






            Gunbrella is a video game about a guy who carries a gun that is also an umbrella. Despite the wordplay in the title, the game is unexpectedly dark and violent, which is surprising considering the team's last game is about a cat on a Metroid-inspired mission. In any case, we like what we've played so far. Gunbrella is coming to PC and Switch some time this year.

Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out some early gameplay and defeat the game's first boss.

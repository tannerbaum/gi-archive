  The Opening Hour Of Resident Evil 4 Remake's Separate Ways DLC | Game Informer Live






            We all assumed the Resident Evil 4 remake would be getting the Ada Wong-focused Separate Ways DLC that was added to the PlayStation 2 version of the game in 2005 at some point. But were all surprised when it was announced to be coming very soon. Join Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart as they play through the first hour or so of the DLC, which is available now!

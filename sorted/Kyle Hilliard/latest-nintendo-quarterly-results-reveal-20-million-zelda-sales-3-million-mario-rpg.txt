  Latest Nintendo Quarterly Results Reveal 20 Million Zelda Sales, 3 Million Mario RPG Sales, And More






            Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.

You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023

Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It's also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.

Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers." It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

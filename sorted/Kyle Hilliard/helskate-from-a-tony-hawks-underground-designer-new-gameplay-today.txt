  Helskate From A Tony Hawk's Underground Designer | New Gameplay Today






            Helskate is a rogue game where you are trying to escape Hell on a skateboard. The game is heavily inspired by the Tony Hawk series, which makes sense as its game director, Steve Swink, worked on Tony Hawk's Underground. Join me and Game Informer's resident Tony Hawk expert, Blake Hester, as we play a bit of the game, discuss its Tony Hawk overlap, and what sets it apart.

Helskate is entering early access on February 15.

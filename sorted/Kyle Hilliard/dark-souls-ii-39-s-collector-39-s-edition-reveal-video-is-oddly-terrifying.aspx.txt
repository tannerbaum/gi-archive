Videos showcasing collector's editions aren't supposed to be scary, but this one is.
One of the many things the Dark Souls series has always been especially good at at, is setting a dreary tone of oncoming dread. Fear permeates throughout the game, which doesn't really bill itself as a horror game. I didn't think that emotion would stretch as far as the game's marketing video for its collector's edition, but somehow it has.
The Collector's Edition includes the case and soundtrack from the Black Armor Edition, as well as a 12 inch, 16 oz. Warrior Knight figure, a hardcover art book, and a full-color fabric map.
You can check out the video below, which is far more dreary than it has any right to be. Dark Souls II (and the Collector's Edition) launches on March 11.

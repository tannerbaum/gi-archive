  The Legend Of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass | Replay






            We've been making our way through The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask the past few weeks for our weekly Replay stream, but this week Marcus Stewart is busy on assignment, so Brian Shea joined me for a look at a different Zelda sequel. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. "I have a lot of sentiment for it,"Aonuma said.

Check out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.

  Three Never-Released-In-America Game Boy Advance Starfy Games Are Available Now For Nintendo Switch Online






            Nintendo added three new games to its Game Boy Advance Nintendo Switch Online library, and though none of the them are Mother 3 (or a Pokémon game or Astro Boy or Drill Dozer or any other GBA game we've been clamoring for) they are none-the-less interesting and completely unexpected.

Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

  Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, And Sonic Superstars | GI Show






            This year has been incredible for video games, October is a particularly good month, and this week alone is impressively stacked. Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and Sonic Superstars all release this week – and we've played them. Brian Shea kicks of the show with his Super Mario Bros. Wonder review impressions, Marcus Stewart talks about his Sonic Superstars review, and the whole crew talks about their time with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 before we finish out with a handful of questions.

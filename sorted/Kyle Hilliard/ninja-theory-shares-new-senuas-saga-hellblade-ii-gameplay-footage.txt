The gameplay footage showed Senua exploring a cave of some kind while dealing with her invasive inner voices. If you've played the original game, its oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere is familiar. Senua entered a pool in the cave while the walls shifted in a kaleidoscopic fashion. The footage was impressive in both visuals and performance.

Unfortunately, noÂ specific release date was offered, but it was given a 2024 release window.

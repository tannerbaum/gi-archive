  Tchia | New Gameplay Today






            Tchia is an impressive, upcoming open world island exploration game about transforming into animals and chasing crabs on your own timetable. Developer Awaceb invited us to take an early look at the game so Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc decided to take a stroll around the island, transform into a deer and a bird, learn where chicken nuggets come from, and launch ourselves from the heights of trees. Tchia doesnt have a locked in release date, but it is planned for release this year on PC and PlayStation platforms.

For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Persona 3 Portable, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.

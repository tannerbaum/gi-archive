  Report: Octopath Traveler Heading To PC In June






Octopath Traveler, the throwback Switch-exclusive Square Enix RPG, showed up on the Korean Ratings Board earlier this week implying that that the game was being ported to PC. The Korean Ratings Board is a pretty consistent source for leaks related to ports, but a new piece of evidence more or less locks in Octopath Traveler's new platform.

According to a report from Gematsu, Square Enix posted a blog on its site announcing Octopath Traveler will be available on June 7 by way of Steam and the Square Enix Store. The blog was pulled down shortly after publication, though, so Octopath's PC release should still be considered a rumor. An admittedly strong rumor, but a rumor none-the-less.

  Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Gives You Lots Of Options For Dancing Like An Idiot






Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is full of specific references to the show and movies in all sorts of different ways. Among the best of its callouts are its many animations, which you can pull up while in the game's lobby. You will find Yamcha's famous death pose, almost every ridiculous pose from the Ginyu force, and my personal favorite, Vegeta's bingo dance from Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods.
We'll have our full review of the game ready soon, but in the meantime, here are some of the game's assorted absurd referential poses and dances.

  Castlevania Returning To Netflix This Summer With Eight New Episodes






The writer behind the first season of Netflix's Castlevania series, Warren Ellis, recently confirmed on twitter that a part two is on the way.
Ellis didn't offer an exact release date, but said eight more episodes are coming this summer.

FAQ: people keep asking, so I guess word didn't get around?  We're coming back this summer, for eight episodes, from @Netflix. pic.twitter.com/HckIke4REI

This is good news... I assume. Castlevania has been languishing on my 
Netflix queue since it launched. I watched the first episode and was 
impressed, and I enjoy the games, but I just haven't gotten back to it. I
 want to though, I promise. For Game Informer's thoughts on the first season of Castlevania, head here.

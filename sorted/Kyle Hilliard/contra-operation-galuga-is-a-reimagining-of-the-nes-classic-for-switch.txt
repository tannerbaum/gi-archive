  Contra: Operation Galuga Is A Reimagining Of The NES Classic For Switch






            Konami and developer Wayforward are bringing a new(ish) Contra to the Switch. Billed as a reimagining of the NES game, it's not quite a remake of the original game but seems to capitalize on the original's vibe and action. The game will feature various difficulty options and up to four-player co-op.

Contra: Operation Galuga releases in early 2024.

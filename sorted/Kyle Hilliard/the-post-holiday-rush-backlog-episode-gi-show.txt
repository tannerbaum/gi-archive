  The Post Holiday Rush Backlog Episode | GI Show






            The year is not over yet, but arguably its biggest rush of video game releases have completed, which means now we actually need to play all of them. Or at least play as many as we can. On this week's episode Marcus Stewart, Kyle Hilliard, and Charles Harte discuss the games they're trying to catch up on including The Talos Principle 2 and Dave the Diver, and of course Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Batman Arkham Knight, and Grounded. We also answer questions from the community and reflect on our 2023 Thanksgiving meals.

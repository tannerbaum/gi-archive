Meta-Genics is currently experiencing its first public playable beta at PAX East, and in honor of the achievement, Team Meat's Edmund McMillen has posted a handful of animated gifs showing the game in action.
You can find the gifs on Edmund McMillen's personal blog. Along with the pair of gifs below, McMillen has also posted a collection of gifs titled, "The forbidden fruit (a Mewgenics love story)," which you can see here.

This is the first time the game's combat elements have been shown off, and McMillen is promising more videos coming soon.
Mew-Genics is coming soon to iPad and Steam. When a fan asked McMillen about the release on his blog he replied, "It's coming out this year, don't worry!"

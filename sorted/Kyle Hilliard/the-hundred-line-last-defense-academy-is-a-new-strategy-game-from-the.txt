  The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy Is A New Strategy Game From The Makers Of Danganronpa






            In The Hundred Line you are Takumi Sumino, a student who is suddenly enrolled at the The Last Defense Academy when an outbreak of monsters threatens his life and the lives of his fellow students. Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.

The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.

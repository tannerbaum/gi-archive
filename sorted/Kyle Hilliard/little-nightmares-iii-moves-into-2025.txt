  Little Nightmares III Moves Into 2025






            Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, "As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."

Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Rest assured, we promise to show you a proper welcome. #LittleNightmares III pic.twitter.com/fqxsOPzkFD

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

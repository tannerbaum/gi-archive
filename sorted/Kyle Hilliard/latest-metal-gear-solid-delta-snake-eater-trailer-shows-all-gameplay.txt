  Latest Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Trailer Shows All Gameplay






            The 2024 Summer Xbox Showcase offered our first substantial look at the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater's (renamed Metal Gears Solid Delta: Snake Eater) gameplay, and the game looks great. The footage thankfully didn't spoil any major story beats for the Metal Gear Solid 3 newcomers, but we saw lots of sneaking, eating, and CQC.

Other details, like whether series creator Hideo Kojima is involved in any way (unlikely) and a release date, are still unknown. But we're still excited to commence the virtuous mission again, hopefully soon.

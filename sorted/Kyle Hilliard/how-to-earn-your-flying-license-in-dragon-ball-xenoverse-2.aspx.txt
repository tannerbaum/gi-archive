  How To Earn Your Flying License In Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2






Earning your flying license in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is no t a complicated or hidden process, but it is something many will be curious about when they start the game.
When you first start Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, its hub area Conton City is open, but only to the locations you can reach by foot. You can fast-travel where you need to go, but seeing others fly around without a care in the world leads to jealousy quickly.
In the game's opening animated introduction, it warns you about the dangers of flying around in Conton City, alerting you that a flying license is necessary. To get one, you must play through the story and defeat Freeza and his brother Cooler. Once you do that, you are free to fly wherever you please, and can even unlock locations that were previously unreachable. I was about level 30 when I obtained my flying license, and I never looked back.

  Replay – Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty






            This week's episode of Replay marks a new era for our weekly show. Replay is now live, and for the first episode we decided to play a classic as voted by you, our viewers.

We also decided to play a whole lot longer than we usually do. We played Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty for two hours, making it beyond the tanker and onto Big Shell. Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, Leo Vader, and me as we talk about why Hideo Kojima is a genius, cut to the all-important ice cam, and just generally appreciate one of our favorite games.

Let us know what you think of the new format in the comments below! And if you want to know more about what the future of Replay will look like, check out last week's episode where we laid it all out!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

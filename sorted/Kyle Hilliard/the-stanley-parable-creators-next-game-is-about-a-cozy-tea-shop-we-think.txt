  The Stanley Parable Creator's Next Game Is About A Cozy Tea Shop (We Think)






            Wanderstop is the next game from the creators of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide, and in it, you are a character named Alta who is running a tea shop, though it seems in the past she was a soldier. The trailer starts with charming, cozy tea shop tasks like serving customers and collecting tea ingredients but ends with Alta on a bench working through a panic attack while convincing herself she is living her best life. Both The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide are games that play with player perceptions and are some of the best uses of taking the interactive medium to tell stories that only video games can tell. Wanderstop looks like a cozy game, but it's safe to assume there is more to it than that.

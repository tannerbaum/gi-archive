Mew-Genics, from Super Meat Boy creators Team Meat, is all about collecting things. Yesterday, in its weekly 'Caturday' blog, Team Meat revealed that cat diseases will be one of those collectibles.
Team Meat revealed that the character Dr. Beanies will be the one collecting diseased cats, and it will have more information about this aspect of the game in the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can download an activity page and create your own diseases. In the image above, Team Meat co-founder and artist Edmund McMillen shares his own creation, and his cat.

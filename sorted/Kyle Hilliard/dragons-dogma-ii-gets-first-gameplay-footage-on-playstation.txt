  Dragon's Dogma II Gets First Gameplay Footage On PlayStation Showcase






            The fan-demanded sequel to Dragon's Dogma has been announced for some time, but during the 2023 PlayStation Showcase, we got our first look at the game's visual direction with a bit of what appears to be gameplay. The footage lacked U.I., but there is no reason not to believe the game will look like this.

The footage shows a very realistic art style with impressive creatures and magic effects. Unfortunately, a release date for the game was not shared.

  My Hero Academia Battle Royale Holding An Open Beta






            My Hero Ultra Rumble, the upcoming battle royale based on the popular manga and anime, My Hero Academia, is holding an open beta that begins later this month.

The beta begins May 25 at 7 p.m. PT and concludes June 1 at 11 p.m. PT on PlayStation 4. It appears all you have to do to participate is download the beta to play, which you can preload by going here.

The game features 24 player matches divided into eight teams of three, with players selecting their favorite heroes and villains from the franchise and taking advantage of their various unique abilities. You can also upgrade your abilities with pick-ups on the map and support your teammates as needed.

The upcoming beta is only for PlayStation 4 (playable on PlayStation 5), but the game is planned for release on Xbox, Switch, and PC, as well. Bandai Namco does not have a proper release date for the game yet, but it will be free-to-play when it officially launches.

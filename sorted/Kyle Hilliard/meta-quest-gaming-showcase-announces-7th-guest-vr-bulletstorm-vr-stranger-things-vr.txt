  Meta Quest Gaming Showcase Announces 7th Guest VR, Bulletstorm VR, Stranger Things VR, Asgard's Wrath 2, And More






            With the airing of The Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, you could argue that we are officially in the season formerly known as E3. This morning, ahead of its stream, Meta shared details about its upcoming Meta Quest 3 headset, which included a few teases for games that would be revealed during its stream, which you can find the details for below.

The showcase ended with the reveal of Asgard's Wrath 2. The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics. You can find more on Asgard's Wrath 2 in the upcoming issue of Game Informer's magazine, where we spoke with the game's director. The other exciting element of the sequel is it will be coming to Quest 2.

The 7th Guest VR appears to be a full remake of the original classic puzzle game but in VR. If you're unfamiliar, The 7th Guest was a landmark puzzle game for PCs that was released in 1993 and featured some of the first use of full-motion video in a video game. You can read our oral history on the game here.

Stranger Things VR is a VR game based on the popular Netflix TV show where you play as season four (and presumably five) antagonist, Vecna, as he comes into power in the Upside Down.

Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable is a VR game based on the popular manga and anime where soldiers fly around the battlefield with swords on grappling tethers while fighting horrifying, gigantic humanoid creatures called Titans. The action shown in the trailer seems incredibly intense.

Bulletstorm VR is a VR port of the 2011 cult-favorite first-person shooter being developed by its original creator, People Can Fly. Regarding the game, People Can Fly says, "Skillshots new and old, as well as the action-packed story—all of it recreated from the ground up to take advantage of VR."

Samba de Amigo is a VR version of the popular Dreamcast and later Wii rhythm game. It is apparently a unique game from the upcoming Switch game, Samba de Amigo: Party Central, but is obviously of the same franchise. It's a concept that seems like it would work very well in VR.

Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord follows a character based in San Francisco who actively hates the Ghostbusters and is attempting to show them up by exploring Alcatraz and unleashing the titular Ghost Lord. The game can be played alone or with up to three co-op partners.

Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice is, expectedly, a VR game based in the Vampire: The Masquerade universe. The trailer for the game describes it as a "blood-soaked adventure RPG" and showcases characters pouncing on unsuspecting victims from the rooftops of Venice, Italy.

PowerWash Simulator VR is, as is the case with many of the games on this list, a VR version of a familiar game. It's unclear if it's an entirely new game or a VR port of the popular 2022 game, but you will definitely be able to clean things in VR, which is the important part.

Death Game Hotel is a new game from Swery, the creator of Deadly Premonition. In the game, players from around the world gather together to play a dangerous, deadly game.

Basically, nothing was revealed about Assassin’s Creed: Nexus VR during the stream other than the fact that it exists and that we will learn more on June 12 during Ubisoft's showcase event.

  Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time Remake Is Coming In 2026






            Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time reemerged during Ubisoft's Forward event, but only slightly. Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.

The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.

Wii Sports Resort


  Wii Sports Club Tennis And Bowling Available Now




The HD re-release of the best-selling video game of all time, Wii Sports, is partially available now on Wii U.
You can download HD, Wii Motion Plus and online enhanced versions of Tennis and Bowling for $9.99 each, or you can purchase a 24-hour pass to each sport for $1.99 each. For the time being, this is how the games will be delivered. In a recent financial briefing Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said, "I do not deny the possibility that Wii Sports Club may become packaged software in the future. However, for the future of Wii U, we have prioritized releasing tennis and bowling by the end of this year." Boxing, baseball, and golf will be coming at some point in the future.
You can check out the launch trailer for the game below, which is set to the tune of a Muzak rendition of Blink 182's "What's my age again?" for some reason.

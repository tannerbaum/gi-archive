  No Rest For The Wicked Cover Story, WWE 2K24, And The Impending Moomin Invasion | GI Show (Feat. Suriel Vazquez)






            This week on The Game Informer Show podcast, host Marcus Stewart is joined by Kyle Hilliard, Charles Harte, and former Game Informer editor/current narrative designer at Big Blue Sky Games, Suriel Vazquez to talk about a smattering of video games, new and old. First up, we dive deep into our most recent cover story for No Rest for the Wicked, talk a bit about how realistic and nauseating the driving is in Pacific Drive, learn about WWE 2K24, and prepare for the impending Moomin invasion. We also mop up on some games like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Penny's Big Breakaway before Suriel shares details about the game he has been working on, Merchants of Rosewall. And we finish out the show by answering some reader questions.

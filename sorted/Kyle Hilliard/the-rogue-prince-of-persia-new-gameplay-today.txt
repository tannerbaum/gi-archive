  The Rogue: Prince Of Persia | New Gameplay Today






            We went nearly 15 years without a wholly new Prince of Persia game after the release of The Forgotten Sands in 2010, but now, in 2024, we will play two brand new Prince of Persia games within six months of one another. The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown released in January, and today we learn about The Rogue: Prince of Persia, which will be entering early access in May.

The game comes from developer Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, and the lineage shows. The game is a 2D platformer roguelike that has a lot in common with Dead Cells, but after spending some hands-on time with the game, it also has its own identity. Join Marcus Stewart and me as I share details about my hands-on experience with the next Prince of Persia.

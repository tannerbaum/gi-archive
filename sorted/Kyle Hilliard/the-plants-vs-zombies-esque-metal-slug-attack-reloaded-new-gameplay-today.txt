  The Plants Vs. Zombies-esque Metal Slug Attack Reloaded | New Gameplay Today






            Metal Slug Attack actually began as a mobile tower defense game for iOS and Android devices many years ago, but today, as part of Nintendo's Summer Direct presentation, it was revealed the game is getting "reloaded" for just about every platform. Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.

Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at some early gameplay from the game and learn why it is scratching their Plants vs. Zombies itch.

  New Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Footage Shows Extended Cutscene And Teases Classic Boulder Run






            The latest footage of MachineGames' Indiana Jones game showed an extended cutscene, some gameplay clips, and a tease of the first film's boulder run. In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is planned for release this year, but we still don't know the release date.

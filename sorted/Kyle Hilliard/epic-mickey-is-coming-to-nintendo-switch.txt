  Epic Mickey Is Coming To Nintendo Switch






            Titled Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the Wii platformer is getting ported and somewhat upgraded for Switch. The game is apparently a "faithful" port of the game as the trailer didn't highlight much in terms of new content or upgrades. But the game does look undeniably sharper.

If you're unfamilair, Epic Mickey for Wii was a Wii game where a classic, mischievous Mickey finds a magic brush that lets him manipulate the world. Its legacy, however, is it marked the return of Walt Disney's original creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit's return to Disney canon.

Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed arrives this year.

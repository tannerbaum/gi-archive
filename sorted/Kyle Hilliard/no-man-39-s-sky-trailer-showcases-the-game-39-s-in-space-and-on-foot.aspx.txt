Hello Games is halfway through a multi-part video series that seeks to answer its game's big questions. The latest shows off the game's combat.

The previous video, Explore, showed off – you guessed it – the game's exploration. You can find it here. The video below, Fight, shows off the game's combat, both on the surface of many planets, and out in space.

No Man's Sky comes out on August 9 for PlayStation 4 and PC.

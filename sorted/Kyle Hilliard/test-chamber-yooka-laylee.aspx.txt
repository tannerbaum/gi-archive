  Test Chamber – Yooka-Laylee's Tribalstack Tropics






We recently got a chance to play Yooka-Laylee for an extended period of time, and wanted to share some of my impressions.
Intern Michael Leri and I got to play around in one of the game's early levels, Tribalstack Tropics, for about an hour, and while we weren't able to record our own gameplay, developer Playtonic did pass along some gameplay footage showing off the level. You can see the level in action below, and hear Michael and I's impressions and explanations about the game's mechanics and collectibles.
For more gameplay from Yooka-Laylee, check out our previous Test Chamber video covering the Toybox, which was basically an unfinished level, here.

  Crackdown 3 – New Gameplay Today Live






            Crackdown 3, the long-in-development follow-up to Crackdown (what's Crackdown 2?), is out on Friday, but we're playing it right now! We'll be streaming the game today at 11 a.m. CT, and you can watch us play on YouTube or Twitch.

Jeff Cork (whose review you will see here on the site, soon) and Kyle Hilliard will be playing the game at about the middle point of the game. We will do our best to not spoil any major story elements and just focus on destruction, so you can watch without fear if you don't want to know what happens in the game's story.

            .

  Crash Team Rumble | New Gameplay Today






            The goal in Crash Team Rumble is blissfully simple: collect and deliver Wumpa fruit. The obstacles in your way (including other players) is what makes that task difficult. Join Game Informer's Wesley LeBlanc and me for a look at Toys for Bob's upcoming online multiplayer game set in the Crash Bandicoot universe. We play a pair of matches and perform surprisingly well. Crash Team Rumble is coming to Xbox and PlayStation consoles on June 20 and will be paid release with no announced plans for Game Pass.

The latest trailer for Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon outlines a looming battle between darkness and light.
Along with its good versus evil allegory, the trailer also reveals new Pokémon you can ride (was that Solgaleo?), what appears to be a Star Fox-style flying sequence (was that Lunala?), as well as a promise that, "This isn't the Alola you thought you knew."
Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon are coming to 3DS on November 17.

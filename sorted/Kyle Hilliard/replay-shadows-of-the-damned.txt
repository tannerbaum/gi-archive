  Replay – Shadows Of The Damned






            In 2011, EA published a game unlike anything it had before or since with Shadows of the Damned. It was born from the minds of Suda 51, known for games like Killer 7 and No More Heroes, and Shinji Mikami, the former Capcom staple behind games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4 among other classics.

Looking toward Resident Evil 4 for gameplay inspiration, Shadows of the Damned tells the story of Garcia Hotspur and his transforming gun sidekick, Johnson, as they explore the underworld in search of Hotspur's kidnapped girlfriend, Paula. The journey is bizarre and full of a surprising amount of interesting world-building and it holds up well almost eight years after release. Well... the gameplay does anyway.

  Who Is Moomin And Why Does His Friend Snufkin Have A Video Game? | New Gameplay Today






            Moomin, the popular Finish comic character from the 1940s, is getting a video game in 2024 – and we're ready for it. You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.

I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.

Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.

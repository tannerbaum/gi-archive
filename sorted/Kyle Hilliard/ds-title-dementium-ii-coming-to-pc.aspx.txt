Dementium II


  DS Title Dementium II Coming To PC




Dementium II originally released on the DS in 2010, and now it's getting ported to PC.
Like the DS game, you take on the role of William Redmoor, a patient of a mental institution for the criminally insane. It appears as though Redmoor may have murdered his wife and children, but his memories are unclear. Redmoor's inner-demons manifest themselves as real demons in the mental institution that he must fight.
Dementium II is set for its PC re-release near the end of this year. You can check out some screens and a teaser trailer for the game below. The game's website is also live, which you can check out by clicking here.

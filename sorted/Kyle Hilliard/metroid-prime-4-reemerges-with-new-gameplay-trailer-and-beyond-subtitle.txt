  Metroid Prime 4 Reemerges With New Gameplay Trailer And Beyond Subtitle






            We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.

Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

  Wolfhound Is Inspired By Metroid And NES Metal Gear | New Gameplay Today






            In Wolfhound, you play as Capt. Chuck “Wolfhound” Rosetti as he explores an island in the Bermuda Triangle. And that island happens to be structured like a classic Metroid game. Whether intentionally or not by developer Bit Kid (the creator Chasm) the game also has flavors of the NES Metal Gear games.

Join me and Marcus Stewart as we check out the game's demo and get excited for Wolfhound's 2025 release.

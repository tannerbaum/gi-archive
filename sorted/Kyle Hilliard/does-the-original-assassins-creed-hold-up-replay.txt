  Does The Original Assassin's Creed Hold Up? | Replay






            This week on Replay Charles Harte (who recently played nearly every Assassin's Creed game) and I are going back to 2007 for a look at the original Assassin's Creed. With Assassin's Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin's Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don't, but in any case, it's a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.

You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin's Creed right here.

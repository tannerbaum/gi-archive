  Reader Discussion: How Important Is The Framerate To You?






The now current-generation of consoles have inspired a number of online debates and comparisons about the importance of resolutions and framerates. Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition has begun a new round of arguments with the revelation that the PlayStation 4 version tends to run smoother than the Xbox One version of the game.
Regardless of your console of choice – PlayStation 4 or Xbox One – you’re going to have a good time with Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition. Both version of the game look great and play great.
The question that has resulted from Tomb Raider, however, is how important is the framerate to the quality of a game? I love games that hit 60 fames-per-second. Call of Duty always looks incredibly smooth, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds arguably felt better to control with the extra frames. Zelda games typically run at around 30 frames-per-second.
That being said, when the choice comes down to having a consistent frame rate or a higher frame rate that will dip and change depending on what is happening on screen, I will choose the former. I rarely find myself complaining a game isn’t hitting 60 frames, but I will complain if it is constantly changing.
How do you feel about the framerate? Does it affect your purchasing practices? Will you not buy a game because it doesn’t hit the right framerate? How important is the framerate to you?

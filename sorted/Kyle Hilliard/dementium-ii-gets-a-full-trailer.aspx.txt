Dementium II


  Dementium II Gets A Full Trailer




Dementium II originally released for the Nintendo DS in 2010, and now it's getting a port to PC and Mac. We've known that the port was in the works for some time, and we got a teaser trailer when it was announced, but now we get to see a much better trailer that gives players a better idea of what Dementium II is all about.
Check it out below, and look for the PC and Mac versions of the game early next year.

  John Carpenter's Toxic Commando Is A Zombie Vehicle First-Person Shooter






            Set to the tune of "You Give Love a Bad Name" by Bon Jovi, John Carpenter's Toxic Commando is a game about fighting zombies in, presumably, the apocalypse. The trailer showed a group of four characters in a car together shooting at zombies in the first-person perspective. The trailer also leaned heavily on vehicle gameplay. The characters are shown in the car together, driving through zombies, and even pulling other vehicles out of the mud.

Little else is known about the game, but it will be available in 2024.

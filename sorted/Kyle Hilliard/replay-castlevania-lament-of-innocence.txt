  Replay â€“ Castlevania: Lament Of Innocence






            On a previous Castlevania-heavy episode of Replay, we played through the opening 10 minutes of Lament of Innocence and were intrigued, but didn't hit a single monster with a whip, so we decided to correct that error by returning to the game this week.

Lament of Innocence released in 2003 on PlayStation 2 and it marked Castlevania's second attempt at a 3D game after the underwhelming Nintendo 64 games (which you can watch us play here and here!). It maintains the formula Koji Igarashi established with his previous Castlevania titles, but adapts it surprisingly faithfully to a 3D setting. Join Andrew Reiner, Suriel Vazquez, and me as we explore Dracula's castle one more time, but probably not one last time.

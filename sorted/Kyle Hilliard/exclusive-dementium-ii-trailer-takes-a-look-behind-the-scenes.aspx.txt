  Exclusive Dementium II Trailer Takes A Look Behind The Scenes




It's been awhile since we heard of any news of Dementium II HD, the formerly DS exclusive horror title making its way to PC and Mac. Today, developer Memetic Games has offered us an exclusive behind the scenes look at development.
As was the case with the first behind the scenes episode of Dementium II, it's not quite what you expect.
Dementium II missed its original early 2013 release window, and now it is simply "coming soon" for PC and Mac. For more on the game, head here, and here.

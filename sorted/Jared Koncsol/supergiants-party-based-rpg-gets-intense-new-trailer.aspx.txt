Supergiant Games, the developer behind Bastion and Transistor, has released a new launch trailer detailing the exiles, Rites, and more, in the mystical purgatory called the Downside.
In Pyre, you are responsible for leading a group of exiles across the Downside, taking on other exiles in an ancient competition called the Rites (that looks a lot like a game of NBA Jam) as you fight to extinguish your enemies' pyre while defending your own. A single orb is the primary tool of destruction in the Rites, and opposing players must take control of the orb and launch it at the opposing team's pyre to cause damage. Each character possesses different innate abilities with unique benefits for combat and traversing the arena, although a general skill tree is also available for leveling up.
The game offers a two-player local multiplayer mode as well as a single-player mode which, upon defeat, adapts the story instead of giving a Game Over.
Check out the launch trailer below.

Ronaldo plays forward for both Real Madrid F.C. and the Portugal national team. He provided data capture for FIFA 18 during a training session in Madrid, which will help EA integrate his unique run cadence, shooting technique, and overall personality into the game. 
As Eurogamer picked up on, the trailer's fine print states that the Switch version does not run on the Frostbite game engine, nor will it contain the story-driven The Journey mode.

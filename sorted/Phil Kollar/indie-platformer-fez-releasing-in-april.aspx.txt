  Indie Platformer Fez Releasing In April






Fez, the perspective-bending platformer from sometimes controversial indie developer Phil Fish, was first revealed back in 2007 and has been slowly inching toward completion since. Now it's finally here, and we'll be able to see if it was worth the wait in just a few weeks.
Over on the official website for Polytron, Fish's developer name, a bright animation reveals that Fez will be hitting Xbox Live Arcade on Friday, April 13. It will be available for 800 Microsoft Points ($10).
So who's going to be checking it out? With all the build-up behind it, Fez may be one of the most anticipated indie games of all time. I know I'll be playing it on Friday the 13th.

So far our line-up of exclusive Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword videos have showcased the game's flying, treasure hunting, and motion controls, but what about the thing we really play Zelda games for -- the dungeons? We've got you covered today with two videos.
In the first video, you can witness Link entering the Fire Temple for the first time and see some of the unique gameplay within, such as the boulder-rolling pictured above. Then, in the brief second video, you can get a very quick look at Scaldera, the imposing boss Link will face at the end of this dungeon.
Watch the videos below and check back tomorrow for our video preview of Skyward Sword and next week for our final exclusive gameplay video.

  Transformers: War For Cybertron Art Gallery






That beautiful image you see above is the Autobot city of Iacon falling apart in the midst of a devastating Decepticon attack. One of High Moon Studios core goals with Transformers: War For Cybertron is to turn the Transformers home planet of Cybertron into a compelling setting that gamers care about. With that in mind, they've shared a whole bunch of concept art (as well as some character art of the titular robots in disguise). Check it out below and let us know what you think!
If you dig the look in these images, be sure to check out our video interview with the War For Cybertron art team for more info on the inspiration for their designs. For continuing Transformers coverage, be sure to keep your eyes peeled to Game Informer's War For Cybertron hub. We've already posted several character profiles, a Transformers history, and a look at High Moon Studios, and we've got more coming for the rest of the month.

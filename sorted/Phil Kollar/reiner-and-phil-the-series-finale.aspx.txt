  Reiner And Phil: The Series Finale






The day we've all dreaded is finally here. After a year-and-a-half of making weird, dumb, and sometimes slightly funny videos with my best friend Andrew Reiner, I'm leaving Game Informer at the end of the week. We knew we had to send off the Reiner and Phil series with something special, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Join us for this emotional, 35-minute final episode in which long-standing mysteries are solved, secrets are revealed, and characters are killed off...forever. Or maybe we just play a crappy Wii game, reminisce, and talk about how much we'll miss each other. Either way, it's must-watch Internet television, folks. Check it out and thanks for sticking with us.

Reiner and Phil may be over, but you can still enjoy our full backlog of misadventures on the Reiner and Phil hub. Be sure to stay tuned to Game Informer for exciting new shows in the near future.

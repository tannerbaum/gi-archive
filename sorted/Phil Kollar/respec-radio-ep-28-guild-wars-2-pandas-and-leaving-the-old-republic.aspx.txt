  Respec Radio Ep. 28: Guild Wars 2, Pandas, And Leaving The Old Republic






It's been a slow year for MMOs so far, but things are about to heat up. On this episode of Respec Radio, we share our experiences with the Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria betas.

As always, I'm joined by Andy McNamara and Adam Biessener. In addition to lots of gushing about Guild Wars and ranting about pandas, we discuss our slow but certain loss of interest in Star Wars: The Old Republic, which may be directly responsible for the lack of Respec Radio episodes of late.

Tune into the show below, catch up on old episodes on the Respec Radio hub page, and subscribe to the show on iTunes or your RSS service of choice via our RSS feed.

  Special Edition Podcast: Transformers: War For Cybertron






If you've been around the site at all this month, you've almost certainly caught some of our month-long coverage of Activision's newly-announced Transformers: War For Cybertron (and if you haven't, you can visit our hub page now and catch up). We've reached the end of our month of exclusive first looks at the game, and we're celebrating with this special edition podcast. Resident Game Informer Transformers nerds Andrew Reiner and Matt Miller join Philip Kollar and Dan Ryckert, who went to see the game last month. The group discusses what would make for a perfect Transformers game, what we've seen of War For Cybertron so far, and a few of the elements -- like co-op and competitive online multiplayer -- that have yet to be fully revealed. Our last podcast of the year also includes a full music track from War For Cybertron.

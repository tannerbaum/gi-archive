  What If Kratos Had Moved Beyond The Greek Gods?






Through the course of the God of War trilogy, Kratos has wiped out a sizable chunk of the Greek pantheon's gods. Assuming the series continues, it's unclear whose divine blood is left to spill. But if David Jaffe, the creator of the first God of War, had stuck with the series, things could have turned out quite differently.
In a recent interview with GamePro [WARNING: the interview at this link contains spoilers about the ending of God of War III], God of War III director Stig Asmussen revealed the original plans for the series that earlier directors David Jaffe and Cory Barlog had:
"What David Jaffe talked about doing was -- and I'm
not sure how it would happen -- basically, you destroy Greek mythology
and then Norse mythology is right around the corner. That's the next
thing that Kratos would go after. It becomes clear at the end that he's
going to become this harbinger of death across different mythologies in
the world and maybe carry the series on from there.
"Cory Barlog talked about Kratos becoming Death. He pretty much
becomes the Grim Reaper at the end of the game and his blades become
sickles. They're both incredibly good ideas, but you need a director to
be passionate about the story and understand it intimately. If I had
used Dave or Cory's idea, I wouldn't have been as passionate about it."
Personally, Kratos moving onto Norse mythology and beyond is a fantasy for the series that I've excitedly expressed before, so I'm a little sad that this isn't the direction the series went in. And seriously, those Egyptian gods are just asking for it. Osiris is a total jerk, and no one will convince me otherwise.

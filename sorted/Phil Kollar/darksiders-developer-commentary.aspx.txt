  Creating The Apocalypse: Darksiders Developer Commentary






On Game Informer's various video series, such as Replay and Reiner and Phil, we get to play games while subjecting you to our dumb observations and jokes. But I've always been interested in the notion of getting the developers' point of view in a similar setting. When I visited Austin-based Vigil Games for this month's Darksiders cover story, I finally got the opportunity to try it out.

Join creative director Joe Madureira, lead designer Haydn Dalton, producer Ryan Stefanelli, general manager David Adams, game director Marvin Donald, and myself as the team looks back on their first creation and reminisces about the ups and downs of development. We take a look at the church dungeon and the Ashlands overworld area and discuss dark development secrets such as the secret meaning of a "nuzzle" and which area of the overworld they should have fixed before the game shipped.

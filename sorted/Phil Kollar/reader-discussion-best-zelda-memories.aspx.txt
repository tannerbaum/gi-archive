  Share Your Favorite Zelda Memories






In our October issue of Game Informer, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series by looking back at all of its major releases. Rather than go over a list of gameplay changes and storylines, though, we approached from a more personal point of view. GI editors wrote essays sharing their personal experiences with each of these games. Now we want to hear from you.
Was A Link to the Past the first video game you ever fell in love with? Did you skip school or work to blast through Wind Waker? Did Twilight Princess inspire you to become a werewolf? Let us know in the comments. We want to hear your favorite and most important memories of Zelda and how these legendary games have had an impact on your life.
I'll be updating this story throughout the month to put the best responses in the story and share them with everyone, so keep an eye out.

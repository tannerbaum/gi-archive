Last week, during our lengthy video preview of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, Dan Ryckert described how much he loves to hate one of the new foes in the latest Zelda -- the tongue-waggling lizard-men pictured above. In our final exclusive video, you can see this enemy in action and discover the moves that will be necessary to take them out.
In addition to showcasing the Lizalfos, this video has a great example of the smart, strategic swordplay you'll need to employ if you want to succeed in Skyward Sword. Just slashing away like a madman won't get you anywhere with bad guys like this. 
Check it out below, and then take a look at our four previous exclusive videos:

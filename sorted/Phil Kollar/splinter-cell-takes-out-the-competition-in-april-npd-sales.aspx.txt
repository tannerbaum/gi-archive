  Splinter Cell Takes Out The Competition In April NPD Sales [Updated With Top 20]






[Updated with full Top 20]
It's been a couple of weeks since April ended, which means NPD has had time to gather and release sales data from last month. In what ended up being an unsurprisingly slow month for the industry, Sam Fisher's latest adventure in Splinter Cell: Conviction took the top of the software charts, while the Wii and DS remained the top-selling hardware.
Without a ton of new releases, April was a pretty slow month for software. The latest Pokemon games for the DS clung to the top of the charts from last month, as did Wii mainstays like New Super Mario Bros., Wii Sports Resort, and Just Dance. Curiously, Wii Fit Plus took the apparently permanent place in the top 10 normally held by Wii Fit. 
The 360 version of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 remained a strong seller, while the PS3 version of the new Super Street Fighter IV eked in at number 10. Notably absent from the top 10 was Capcom's other big April release, Monster Hunter Tri.
Check out the full software list below, but note that as of this month NPD is only offering up actual sales numbers for the top five games:

On the hardware side, every system experienced a drop in sales from March's numbers. The actual sales rankings remain the same, but the PS3 has gotten even closer to closing the gap between its sales and the Xbox 360's. Notably, NPD has finally chosen to remove PlayStation 2 sales from their report, although as of last month the last-gen console was selling nearly as many units as the PSP. 
Here are the numbers:
1. Nintendo DS - 440,800 units sold2. Wii - 277,200 units sold3. Xbox 360 - 185,400 units sold4. PlayStation 3 - 180,800 units sold5. PSP - 65,500 units sold

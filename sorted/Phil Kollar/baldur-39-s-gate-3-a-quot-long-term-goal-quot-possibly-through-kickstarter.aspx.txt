  Baldur's Gate 3 A "Long-Term Goal," Possibly Through Kickstarter






When Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition was announced at the end of a mysterious countdown last week, some fans who had been hoping for a brand new Baldur's Gate experience were disappointed. Don't fret quite yet though. Enhanced Edition developer Overhaul Games says it still hopes to move onto a Baldur's Gate 3 one day.
Speaking with GameSpy, Overhaul Games' Cameron Tofer explained how the studio hopes to tackle a brand new Baldur's Gate eventually:
"Baldur's Gate 3 has been our long term goal. We have a lot of things to put in place before such a project can be launched. So currently there is no such project but that's the one we want to do. Our thoughts have been that Enhanced Edition for BG 1 and 2 just make sense before there's any Baldur's Gate 3."
Tofer went on to suggest that the studio may look into funding Baldur's Gate 3 via Kickstarter, particularly after inXile's recent successful attempt at crowd-funding Wasteland 2, another old-school computer RPG sequel.
We may still be waiting a while for that dream project, particularly if Overhaul plans to finish Enhanced Editions for both of the massive first two games, but the teenage computer gamer in me feels warm and fuzzy knowing that this once-beloved franchise that I sunk hundreds of hours into may be preparing for a rebirth.

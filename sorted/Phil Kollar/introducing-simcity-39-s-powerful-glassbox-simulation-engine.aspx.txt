A long-rumored new SimCity game was finally announced by EA at GDC, but details were light. Now developer Maxis is starting the hype machine, but instead of focusing on impressive graphics or approachable gameplay, the first video is all about the game's new complex simulation engine.
Watch the two-minute video below to get your first glimpse of the Glassbox engine. You'll see examples of how the buildings you set up will have an impact on the environment and natural resources and vice versa. Just keep in mind that the graphics on display in the video are placeholder and nowhere near final, so the actual game will presumably look a lot nicer.

  Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition To Cost Less Than $10, Enhanced BG II Coming






If you're worried that the upcoming Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition for iPad will have a massive price to match its epic size, worry not. Apparently the game will be less than $10.
This happy news comes via Kotaku, who also report that the Enhanced Edition will support co-op multiplayer, a feature of the original that has been long-forgotten in many modern computer RPGs. Despite the game's size, Beamdog COO Cameron Tofer says that charging more than $10 "doesn't make sense."
If that's not enough to make the computer RPG fans in the audience cheer, Tofer also confirmed earlier reports that Beamdog is simultaneously working on an enhancedÂ version of Baldur's Gate II for the iPad. BG II: Enhanced Edition is also expected to be out this year.

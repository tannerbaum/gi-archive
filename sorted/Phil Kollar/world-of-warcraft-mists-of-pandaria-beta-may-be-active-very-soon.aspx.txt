  World Of Warcraft: Mists Of Pandaria Beta Is Live






Update: Blizzard says the Beta test has now started and invitations will be rolling out to Annual Pass holders, press, fansites, friends and family, and opt-in beta testers.
 This first phase of the beta focuses on the 1-10 starting experience for new Pandaren. High-level content as well as template characters will become available in future beta updates, but you can still copy over your own high level characters now if you’d like to test the new talent system.
---------------------------------------
Blizzard has recently started spilling more info on the upcoming fourth World of Warcraft expansion, Mists of Pandaria, but it looks like that flood of details isn't going to stop any time soon.
WoW Insider reports that players chosen for the first round of the beta now have access to the beta download client on their Battle.net accounts. As of right now, the download process isn't yet functioning, but that's likely to change some time tonight. 
Despite not having had time to play WoW for months and being totally crushed by deadline, I'm absolutely planning to refresh my Battle.net account over and over tonight to see if I got in the beta. Anyone else joining me?

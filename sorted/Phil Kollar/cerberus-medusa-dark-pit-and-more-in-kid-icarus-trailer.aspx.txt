Kid Icarus: Uprising - 3DS


  Cerberus, Medusa, Dark Pit, And More In Kid Icarus Trailer




The Kid Icarus franchise will be making its long-awaited return on the 3DS early next year. This latest trailer from Nintendo shows off some of the mythical creations you'll be up against when you step into the toga of winged protagonist Pit.
The two-minute trailer below gives you a look at the multi-headed dog monster pictured above, as well as several other foes Pit will face, including a shadow double. You'll also get a taste of Pit's, um, interesting sense of humor. Hope you like dog jokes!

  Reader Mailbag: The Phil Kollar Exit Interview






For tomorrow's Game Informer Show podcast, we're doing something special. Since it's my last week at Game Informer, we're doing a special edition of our recurring reader mailbag segment where it will be your last chance to ask me any burning questions you have before I take off.
Still upset about a review score from two years ago? Wondering what I think of your favorite childhood game? Desperately need my opinion on which variety of sandwich you should have for lunch tomorrow? Whatever questions you have, leave them in the comments below. Host Matt Helgeson will pick out the best ones and dig for the hard answers that you deserve tomorrow.
Please post your questions by 12 p.m. Central tomorrow, March 29.

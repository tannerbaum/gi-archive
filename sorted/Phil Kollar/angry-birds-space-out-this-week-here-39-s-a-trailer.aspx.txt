The latest iteration of the popular mobile series Angry Birds is launching this week. To celebrate, developer Rovio has released a trailer.
The video is brief, but there's just enough here that cell phone gamers who wasted hours on older iterations of Angry Birds will probably start feeling the pull immediately. Look for Angry Birds Space to arrive on iOS, Android, PC, and Mac in just a couple of days (March 22), and watch for our impressions soon.

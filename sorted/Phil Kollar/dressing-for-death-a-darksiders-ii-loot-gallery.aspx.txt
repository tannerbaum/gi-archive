  Dressing For Death: A Darksiders II Loot Gallery






One of the biggest game-changers for Darksiders II is the addition of loot to the game's formula. Players will be able to change both the stats and physical appearance of the main character, making this sequel a much more customizable experience. To demonstrate some of these possibilities, Vigil helped us put together the following loot gallery.
Using this web app, you can choose which pieces of this singe set of stylish purple armor you want Death to wear. You can also equip him with a hammer or his traditional dual scythes. Enjoy playing around with it and just think of the full dress-up possibilities when Darksiders II comes out next year.

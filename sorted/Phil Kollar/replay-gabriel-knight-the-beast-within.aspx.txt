  Replay â€“ Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within






Since this is my last week here at Game Informer, the higher-ups made the mistake of letting me choose what game to check out in a special bonus edition of Replay. I chose The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery, one of my favorite adventure games of all time and the reason I have a soft spot for full-motion video.
On this episode, I'm joined by Jeff Cork, Andrew Reiner, and Joe Juba as we discover the latest predicament that supernatural investigator Gabriel Knight finds himself in. Be prepared for ridiculous hats, "verevolves," and some early info from an article on the Gabriel Knight series that will be running in the May issue of Game Informer.

  Replay â€“ Urban Chaos






I'm sure I wasn't the only gamer who played Batman: Arkham Asylum last year, loved it, and thought to myself, "Where did these Rocksteady guys come from?!" Though it's largely been forgotten, the team at Rockstead did create one game before last year's huge success: Urban Chaos: Riot Response, a 2006 first-person shooter for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.

As the final piece of our month of Batman: Arkham City coverage online, we decided to revisit Rocksteady's past. Join Bryan Vore, Jeff Cork, Andrew Reiner, and I as we team up with firefighters, cops, and medics to take down a gang and save...my mom? Uh, just check out the video below.

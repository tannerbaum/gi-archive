Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2: Innocent Sin


  Learn How To Talk To Demons




With the September 20 release date for Atlus' PSP remake of Persona 2: Innocent Sin fast approaching, now might be a good time to acquaint yourself with the delicate art of demon negotiation.
In this new trailer, Atlus shows off how your party can talk to demons rather than fighting them, which can lead to great rewards. Those rewards, in turn, can be used to summon new and more powerful Personas to aid you in battle. 
Check out the video below for a full demonstration, and for more on Persona 2 take a look at the latest batch of screenshots that we posted in August.

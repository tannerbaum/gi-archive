  Bayonetta Joins Cast Of Anarchy Reigns






[Update] Platinum Games has released a video showing Bayonetta in action. She seems to have many of the moves from her game, which honestly makes me a lot more interested in Anarchy Reigns. Check out the video for yourself below.
While office Bayonetta expert Joe Juba has been eagerly awaiting the return of Sega's 2010 action heroine, I'm not sure that this was what he had in mind. Gun-wielding witch Bayonetta has been confirmed as a playable character for Platinum Games' upcoming brawler Anarchy Reigns.
The news comes courtesy of Famitsu (via Andriasang), which says that the character will serve as a pre-order bonus in Japan. There's no official word from Sega as to whether that will also be the case in North America, but we'll update if we hear anything.
Bayonetta isn't the only Platinum Games alum to appear in Anarchy Reigns. The game also features Jack Cayman, the main character from Platinum's bloody Wii exclusive, MadWorld.
Anarchy Reigns is due out in all territories this summer. For more info, check out our hands-on preview from Gamescom.

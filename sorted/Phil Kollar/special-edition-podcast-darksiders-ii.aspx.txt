  Special Edition Podcast: Darksiders II






It's been a long and exciting month full of online features to go along with our Darksiders II cover story. To wrap up all of this coverage, we invited the game's producer, Ryan Steffanelli, and its creative director, David Adams, onto our podcast to discuss the origins of the franchise, the changes in the sequel, what's up with the other two Horsemen, and more.

Listen to the full show below, and then return to the site tomorrow for one final Darksiders II bonus feature before we move on to our next cover story.

Technical note: As with most phone interviews, please note that the guys calling in from Vigil will sound a bit quiet. Nothing a quick bump to your volume button can't fix, but watch out for the music bumpers at the beginning and end of the show. Your ears have officially been warned!

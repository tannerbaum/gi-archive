  Special Edition Podcast: Batman: Arkham City






Earlier this week, we took your questions, and now we have some of the answers. In this special edition podcast, Jeff Cork and Bryan Vore join me to talk about their cover trip to see Batman: Arkham City. We talk about some of the details gleaned from that trip and speculate on what we expect and hope to see from Arkham City, from villain appearances to boss battles to the possibility of co-op.

  Analyst: Grand Theft Auto V Not Likely This Year






With Grand Theft Auto V finally being officially announced via a teaser trailer late last year, many fans were hopeful that Rockstar's latest open-world crime game would make it out in 2012. One analyst is predicting that will not be the case.
Forbes reports that Sterne Agree analyst Arvind Bhatia is advising that GTA V will likely ship in the March 2013 quarter rather than the December 2012 quarter. Bhatia says publisher Take-Two would benefit from this timeframe with less competition and a greater install base on current consoles. He also suggested that the game could launch on Nintendo's new Wii U console.
Keep in mind that this is one analyst's prediction. As of yet, Take-Two has yet to provide any comment on when Grand Theft Auto V will come out.

  Transformers: War For Cybertron Character Profile – Optimus Prime






This is the first of several character profiles we'll be running for Transformers: War For Cybertron, showcasing exclusive concept art and the new visual style that High Moon Studios is using in the game. We'll kick things off with everyone's favorite Autobot leader, Optimus Prime. You can check out his new vehicle form above and his robot form below. 
Though Optimus is a powerful and respected Transformer at the start of War For Cybertron, he is not yet the leader of the Autobots. After a devastating Decepticon attack on his home city of Iacon, Optimus is forced to step up and help lead his people to victory – wherever that might be. 
In robot form, Optimus' main weapon is the Ion Blaster, a special gun that's totally unique to him. His vehicle mode, on the other hand, resembles the truck we all know him as, but actually operates as a Cybertronian tank. His special abilities include Warcry and Mark Target. Though we're not entirely sure what these are yet, it sounds like they may be more focused on buffing allies than full-out assault. 
Stay tuned to Game Informer for two more big character profiles from War For Cybertron in the coming weeks. You can watch for those and all of our other Transformers: War For Cybertron coverage in our War For Cybertron hub.

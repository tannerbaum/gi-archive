  Sable Is A Gorgeous Upcoming Indie Exploration Game






            At the PC Gamer E3 conference, we got a closer look at Sable in a surreal and gorgeous trailer.  Set to the music of Japanese Breakfast, the titular Sable explored ruins and the desert on her hoverbike.

Japanese Breakfast will be doing the entire soundtrack, and the game itself is developed almost entirely by a two man team at Shedworks. Sable draws its art style from Studio Ghibli films and clear line French comics. 

You play as Sable, a young girl who leaves home to explore the world and learn about the people, the history and the culture. The game is devoid of combat and focuses on travel and solitude in the desert. 

Sable has no release date yet, and it will be on PC published by Raw Fury.

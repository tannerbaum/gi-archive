  Insomniac Games Teases New VR Project






In a new developer spotlight, Insomniac has teased a new exploration-based VR game on the Oculus. The studio hints at a solution to the issue of movement in an open-world environment, eschewing the typical short-range teleportation system that many VR games currently use. The game sounds like it could be a mix of the ambition of No Man's Sky and the quality of world design that Insomniac is known for. Hopefully we will see a hand-crafted open world or galaxy that will allow players to explore and discover and run into the fun and vibrant characters that the studio does so well.

Our Take:It looks like Insomniac is still fully in support of VR. I am glad to see developers still taking chances and trying to find the full potential of the format. Insomniac has made some amazing games (Sunset Overdrive is my jam) and I want their signature style and creativity to carry over to an open-world VR game.That would be something to get me interested in finally taking the plunge of picking up a headset.

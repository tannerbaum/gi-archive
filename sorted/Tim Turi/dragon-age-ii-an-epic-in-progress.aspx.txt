  Dragon Age II: An Epic In Progress






During our trip to visit BioWare and check out Dragon Age II, we were afforded a few quick looks at the game in progress. Not only were we able to see how video, audio, and animation were coming along, but we also got a close look at the evolving combat gameplay. Come along with Game Informer as we take you on a quest to see the sequel to BioWare's epic RPG in its early stages.
It bears repeating that this is footage of a game super early on, and that it in no way reflects the quality of the finished product. That means you should reserve any final judgments until your holding the final version of the game in your hands.

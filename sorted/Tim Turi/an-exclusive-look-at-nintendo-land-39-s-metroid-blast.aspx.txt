Previously shown at E3 2011 as Battle Mii, the shooter-focused Nintendo Land attraction has since morphed into a full-blown Metroid homage. This exclusive trailer focuses on the Deep Space Shootout mode which pits on-foot players against a player flying Samus' spaceship.
The Miis running around on the ground use a Wii Remote and nunchuck to gun down the flying spacecraft, while the vessel's pilot uses a GamePad to steer and shoot using the controller's motion technology. The attraction supports up to five players and is easily one of Nintendo Land's funnest destinations demoed so far.

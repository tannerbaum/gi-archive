  GI Show: Destiny: The Taken King, Galak-Z, Team Meat Interview






Bungie's latest sci-fi shooter has been divisive among the gaming community ever since it launched to mixed reviews last September. Whether you love it or hate it, fans are still passionately discussing Destiny a year later. That conversation overflows into the latest episode of the GI Show, thanks to our recently revealed cover story for Destiny's The Taken King expansion. Destiny fans have a lot to learn, but even those on the fence might find Bungie's new changes enticing.

In addition to Ben Hanson, Matt Miller, and Ben Reeves recounting their recent trip to Bungie's studio in Washington, we also dive into the new sci-fi shooter roguelike, Galak-Z: The Dimensional, and recount our recent hands-on with the rebooted Guitar Hero. After that, stick around as Ben Hanson and I catch up with Team Meat, the creators of Super Meat Boy. We cover a wide range of topics, including the exciting news that the developers of the tough-as-nails side-scroller are experimenting with a Super Meat Boy sequel.

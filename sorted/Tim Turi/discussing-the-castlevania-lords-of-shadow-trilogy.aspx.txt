  Discussing The Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow Trilogy






MercurySteam didn't just create the first worthwhile 3D Castlevania game with 2010's Lords of Shadow, they started a whole trilogy. With the 3DS's Mirror of Fate and Lords of Shadow 2 on the spooky, moonlit horizon, Matt Miller and I discuss the trilogy and the future of the franchise.
In the video below, I take advantage of the fact that Miller just recently finished Lords of Shadow, pulling him into a conversation about the series' future, what it might be like to play as Dracula, and more.

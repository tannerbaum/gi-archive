  Sony: God Of War III Making A Killing






            Sony’s vice president of marketing, Peter Dille, shared some interesting God of War III-related news at the MI6 marketing conference yesterday in San Francisco. In just a few short days, Kratos has apparently amassed a huge body count.According to Dille, God of War III sold 1 million units in North America in “just a couple days” following the game’s launch on March 16. We’ve yet to learn how the game is performing in other countries (it hit shelves in Europe and Australia on March 18 and 19, respectively). We'll go out on a limb and predict it’s doing well in those places, too.Stay tuned for the official NPD numbers when they arrive mid-month. Do you think God of War III has what it takes to top the charts for March after only a few weeks of availability?Source: CVG

  Four-Player Shenanigans In New Super Mario Bros. U






Wii owners got their fill of chaotic four-player co-op in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and the frenzy continues with the Wii U sequel. This trailer highlights the gorgeous new HD graphics, fun with baby Yoshis, and gliding around with the flying squirrel suit.
This trailer shows a gigantic Koopa ship soaring through the background, dimly lit caverns, and impressive platforming skills. Not shown in this trailer is the Wii U GamePad functions available to the fifth player. A fifth player will be able to touch the GamePad's touchscreen to place supportive platforms across levels.

  The Fate Of Kratos Revealed?






A new update to God of War III's teaser site features the outline of a man staring at a rain puddle. In concurrence with quick lightning flashes, the visage of a stoic man standing tall appears. Could this image be the legendary Spartan?
WARNING!
*God of War III Spoilers*
At the end of God of War III, Kratos shoves a sword through this own gut to release Athena's hope upon the world. As the blood runs from the epic god-slayer, we're left wondering about his true fate.
The new update to the teaser site (Spartans Stand Tall) reveals that Kratos may be right as rain, even following suicide.

Thinking back to Gamepro's chat with God of War III director Stig Asmussen offers some insight to this new development.
"That's a big reason that it was written the way it was, with Kratos killing himself at the end," said Asmussen. "That's also why we put the epilogue in the end that leaves that little bit of tension about whether he's dead or alive"
"I don't know if he's dead or alive right now--maybe he is dead, and that's it. We kept the Blade of Olympus around as well, and we've got ideas of things we could do with that. Maybe there's powers contained within the Blades of Olympus; maybe there's a little piece of Kratos that's still inside there," the director hints. "There's a couple different tools we could use, and there's definitely room to expand on things."
"If I were to bring Kratos back, I know exactly how I would want to do it. But I can't tell you," teased Asmussen. "I know exactly how I would do it, and it's not anything you'd expect, guaranteed. "
Is Kratos rising to take on Norse mythology or another pantheon next?

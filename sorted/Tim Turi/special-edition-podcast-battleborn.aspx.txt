  Special Edition Podcast â€“ Battleborn






This month has been a long, exciting parade of exclusive Battleborn info following our cover reveal of the innovative FPS. We're capping off the month-long look with a special podcast starring developers from Gearbox and the Game Informer crew.

Battleborn's creative director Randy Varnell and lead writer Aaron Linde called in to discuss the game with GI's Ben Hanson and Tim Turi, who provided a rapid-fire volley of questions straight from the community. We touch on topics like the accessibility of the on-the-fly leveling system, how the co-op campaign is structured, and the overall reception to Battleborn's reveal.

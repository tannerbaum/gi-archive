  Bulletstorm PC Demo Arriving Post-Release






Sorry to break the news to you, PC-owning Bulletstorm enthusiasts, but you're going to have to wait for a taste of Bulletstorm until after the game's February 22 release.
Unlike 360 and PS3 owners, who received a sample of the game's Anarchy mode weeks ago, PC users will have to wait just a little while longer. "Bulletstorm PC demo is in the works!  Won't make it in time for ship date but should be available shortly after," said Mark Rein, vice president of Epic via his Twitter.
Be sure to check back tomorrow for our review of the game, and to see what you PC owners are missing . That sort of felt like I was rubbing salt in the wound there. Is there a skillshot for that? For more salt-rubbing, check out our video preview of Bulletstorm.

  First Dragon Age II Details Take Flight






            Earlier today we revealed that Dragon Age II is splattered across the cover of our August issue. We also informed you that BioWare kicked off the sequel to their award-winning RPG with a new website. Now we’re pleased to bring you some of the very first details about the game, such as the new protagonist’s legendary role, the change in combat, and more. According to Dr. Ray Muzyka, senior vice president of EA and co-founder of BioWare, “Dragon Age 2 will simultaneously deliver an epic story and set a new bar for intense action in the genre.”We’d expect nothing less than a jaw-dropping story from a BioWare game, but the company’s new emphasis on action is interesting. The game promises that players will be able to “think like a general and fight like a Spartan,” so we’ll see what that exactly entails as more unfolds.The game is also going to serve as a “new entry point” for newcomers, according to executive producer Mark Darrah. He also asserts that BioWare is working hard to make sure “fans of the original game retain a sense of satisfaction and familiarity in the world.” This may simply mean referencing events of the first game, or it could also mean a Mass Effect 2-style save transfer is being planned.Finally, the new protagonist has been named Hawke. He is a “penniless refugee who rises to power to become the single most important character in the world of Dragon Age.” And here you thought your Grey Warden was such a bad ass. It sounds like players will spend much of the game deciphering the truth around the myth of the Champion of Kirkwall. How did he rise to power? How did he survive the blight? Why does he hold so much clout? We’ll have to wait and see.Be sure to grab the August issue of Game Informer to learn more.

  Bulletstorm Didn't Make A Profit For Epic






According to the president of Epic Games, Mike Capps, Bulletstorm didn't make a profit. However, the publisher isn't regretting the project.
The joint project by Epic and People Can Fly "didn't make money for us," said Capps speaking with Kotaku.Instead of mourning the lack of profit, Capps is happy that the company green-lit something different, instead of cashing in on another Gears of War entry.
"The studio has shipped AAA content," he said. "The next thing we do with People Can Fly will be great."
We loved Bulletstorm, and can't wait to see what comes of future collaborations. Hopefully the game will still reward players for groin shots.

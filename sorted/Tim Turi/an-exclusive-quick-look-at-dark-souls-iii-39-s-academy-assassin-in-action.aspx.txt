  An Exclusive Quick Look At Dark Souls III's Academy Assassin In Action






Dark Souls III is on the cover of Game Informer's October issue, so that means we've got a month of extra Dark Souls action coming your way. Today is a brief look at the starter class template, the Academy Assassin, complete with an tri-cornered hat that looks like it's straight out of From Software's Bloodborne.
The Academy Assassin, like the previously announced Northern Warrior or Wandering Knight, is a template class players can start out with in Dark Souls III. This video shows off the masked Academy Assassin facing off against a knight with a spear, small buckler, and a handful of impressive Soul spells. Dan Tack and I introduce the short gameplay clip and offer some context during the video below.

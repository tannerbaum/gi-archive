New Character ClassesWe don’t know too much about the new classes in Dead Island 2, but we do have their names. The classes are berserker, speeder, bishop, and hunter. The berserker seems to be a beefy damage-dealer that specialized in two-handing huge, powerful weapons. The bishop is a man of the cloth with a post-apocalyptic flair for violence. Little else is known beside the fact that all four will have unique Fury attacks (special abilities that can be activated after killing enough zombies).

Dead Island 2 is being developed on Unreal Engine 4 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s due out in the spring of next year. Here’s hoping Deep Silver’s new developer can deliver on the potential of the original.

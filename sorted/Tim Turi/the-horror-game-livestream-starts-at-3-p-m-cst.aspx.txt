  Watch Us Play Three Horrifying Games






October isn't quite here yet, but the spirit of Halloween is already in the air. And while leaves are falling and folks pick out their favorite pumpkins this time the year, we prefer to sequester ourselves indoors with some really scary games. Issue #258 of Game Informer is all about horror, with in-depth previews on upcoming games in the genre and a breakdown of the Top 25 Horror Games of All Time. In keeping with that celebration, Jeff Cork and I recorded a blood-splattered collection of horror games from this generation. On the chopping block are P.T., Outlast, and Neverending Nightmares.

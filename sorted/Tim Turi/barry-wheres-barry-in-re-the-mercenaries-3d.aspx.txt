Resident Evil: The Mercenaries - 3DS


  Barry? Where's Barry? In RE: The Mercenaries 3D




Can you name the man who simultaneously holds the crown for coolest Resident Evil character and most underutilized? You're right, it's Barry Burton. The man with the hand cannon first appeared on the undead scene in 1996's original Resident Evil for PlayStation, and has been reduced to cameo appearances and a god awful Game Boy Color game ever since. In Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D he still only has a minor part (considering everyone in the game is only blasting apart strange creatures), but a little Barry is better than no Barry.
Barry Burton joins the cast alongside mainstays Chris Redfield, Hunk, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers and Claire Redfield. Also, Krauser is in the game.
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D hits the 3DS on June 28. Until then, check out these hilarious Barry remixes.

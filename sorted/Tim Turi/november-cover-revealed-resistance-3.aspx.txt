  November Cover Revealed: Resistance 3






A batch of stunning Resistance 3 screenshots recently hit the web, but those pretty pictures of Insomniac's upcoming PS3 shooter are a mere glimpse into the harrowing world that's awaiting new protagonist Joe Capelli. Our exclusive cover story is stuffed with never-before-told info on the new hero, the brutal Chimera-ruled world, changes to gameplay, and even a glimpse at new weaponry and threats.
Besides ten full pages on Resistance 3, we've got some other awesome features arriving with the November Issue of Game Informer #211. There are six entire pages dedicated to Team Ico's hotly anticipated The Last Guardian, new info on Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, a flowchart of every RPG ever, and our third (hilarious) Sacred Cow Barbecue in which we grill legendary titles like World of Warcraft and Resident Evil 4.
If that's not enough, you can look forward to a month full of exclusive online Resistance 3 content on this very website. Stay tuned for the Resistance 3 hub launch this Friday. The November issue will be hitting subscribers this Monday, October 11, and will be in stores October 15.

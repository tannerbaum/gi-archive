  Halo 3 Outsold Sony’s Biggest Titles Combined






            Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg has an inside scoop from the NPD. The juicy morsel of data he has concerns Halo 3 outselling some of the biggest PS3 titles in existence…combined. Though it appears to be a jab by Microsoft at Sony, it really puts things in perspective. “Just in from research team (NPD): Halo 3 has outsold Resistance 1 + 2, Uncharted 1 + 2, Killzone 2 and God of War III COMBINED….wow,” tweeted Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg. Though the exact number of sales to date for Halo 3 has yet to be revealed, this bit of news speaks volumes.Personally, I’d have to say that God of War III is my personal favorite among all those mentioned titles, with Uncharted 2 taking a close second. Which title do you think deserves to be the leader in sales?

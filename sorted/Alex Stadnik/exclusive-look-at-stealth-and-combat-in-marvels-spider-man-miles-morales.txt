  Exclusive Look At Stealth And Combat In Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales






            From the game's first boss fight to catching up with Peter and Miles, we've already seen a lot from Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. But the fun doesn't stop there! 

One of the main ways Insomniac is differentiating the two web-slinging heroes is through their abilities in combat. While Miles will still have access to a plethora of spider gadgets, he'll also be able to camouflage himself to surprise his foes when players want to go in a bit quieter.

Join us for this exclusive look at how Miles fares in combat using both stealth and his new electric powers!

            Topic Of The Show:

            Is Lost Ark The Next Great MMO?

            Many MMOs have riveted fans for years, but recently it's felt like there's been a void despite Final Fantasy XIV's ongoing success and the recent release of New World. However, another challenger is approaching in Lost Ark, developer Smilegate's long-running MMO action RPG that is finally playable by Western audiences. Join John, Van Aken, and Stadnik as they discuss their hands-on impressions and tell you whether or not this popular MMO is worth diving into.

            Discussing Sifu's Highs And Lows

            Sifu is a complicated game. On the one hand, it has fantastic combat and great action setpieces. On the other though, the game is filled with systems and complications that we didn't gel with. Ben Reeves breaks down his game review and discusses the details of his time playing developer Slocap's Kung Fu action title.

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            The GI community continues to send us exciting podcast questions. This week we're chatting about whether or not the Oscars will ever nominate a video game movie for Best Picture, which games have exceeded our hype levels or disappointed us, and which gaming studio we'd buy amidst the current acquisition spree.

Read this week's questions below and submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

With the Oscar nominations being revealed and the Uncharted movie, SUP GI FAM is finally releasing NEXT WEEK. What is your favorite video game movie? Do you think a film based on a video game will ever win, let alone be nominated for Best Picture? If so, why will it be Sonic The Hedgehog 2 or The Super Mario Bros. movie? - One Mean Leafeon Machine (Discord)

Let's be honest. We all fall prey to hype. Sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. What game was your biggest disappointment, and what game most exceeded even your lofty expectations? - Shifujju (Discord)

Good news! Game Informer has enough money to buy one AAA or smaller indie developer to create any new game or game under their IPs. Which developer would you all agree to buy? - BiscuitsWithDavey (Discord

            Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Hands-On Preview

            We don't mean to brag, but Brian Shea got to play Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy ahead of its October 26 release! In today's show, we discuss how the character interactions felt and whether the game's writing fits the series' iconic characters. Shea also breaks down how the game involves Rocket, Gamora, Drax, and Groot while players only have complete control over Star-Lord.

I have been listening to the GI crew since the Hanson era, and I finally worked up the courage to write in, I'm twenty-eight years old, and I'm from Cincinnati. My question to everyone is, how do you get into the gaming industry? Gaming is my one true passion, and I want to be in the marketing side of the industry. I have hopes of one day working for Sony, Sucker Punch, or Game Informer. My favorite games are Ghost Of Tsushima,  Marvel's Spider-Man, and Soul Calibur 6. Thanks again, and talk about more fighting games, please! - Brandon (email)

So, with the switch now getting Bluetooth audio support, and an upcoming OLED screen. Nintendo is finally catching up to the Vita. That said, why do you think the Vita failed so spectacularly when compared to the switch given how advanced it was at the time? Was it because it can't play Nintendo games? The rejection of standardized data storage? Some combination? Why is the switch so much more successful when it's technologically only catching up with 2012? - Crayter (Discord)

  Replay — Halo: Reach Co-Op






            After fans finished the fight in Halo 3 and ODST, many wondered where the landmark series would go next. Three years later, they got their answer in Halo: Reach as Bungie took us back to one of most important and devastating events in the war between the humans and the Covenant. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, and me as we squad up in co-op to save the doomed planet of Reach alongside the rest of Noble Team.

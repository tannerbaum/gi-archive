  Creating The World Of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales






            In 2018, Marvel's Spider-Man delighted many who donned the mask and stylishly swung through the streets of New York City. Developer Insomniac Games created a gorgeous love letter to the wall-crawler and his fans, making for one of the most successful superhero video games of all time.

But how does a developer follow up on that kind of success? That's where Brian Horton, creative director at Insomniac Games, and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales comes in. Join us as we sit down with Brian and discuss how he and the team made Miles stand out from other web-slingers, what players can expect from the game's world after the events of the original game, and how the PlayStation 5 helped the team craft a true next-gen experience.

Also, we get into spoilers for the original game so if you haven't played it yet, you have been warned!

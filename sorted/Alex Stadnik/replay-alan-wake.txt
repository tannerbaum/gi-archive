  Replay — Alan Wake






            Back in 2010, our own Andrew Reiner wrote that Remedy Entertainment and Sam Lake's psychological thriller "redefines video game storytelling." Since its release 10 years ago this week, Alan Wake has gained a cult following because of its dream-like (or nightmare-inducing) storytelling, chilling atmosphere, and memorable characters. To celebrate the game's anniversary, Reiner, Ben Reeves, and I are returning to Bright Falls to see if we can handle all the spookiness on today's new episode of Replay.

We went live earlier but you can catch the full stream archive above. If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week!

If you want more Alan Wake and Remedy, be sure to check out our interview with the game's writer Sam Lake. Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

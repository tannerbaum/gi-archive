  Replay — Spore






            After the success of The Sims franchise, many wondered what the illustrious Will Wright would work on next. The answer became clear in 2005 when the legendary developer announced Spore, an ambitious creature creator/god game that saw players make new alien lifeforms and have them become the top dog on the planet and beyond.

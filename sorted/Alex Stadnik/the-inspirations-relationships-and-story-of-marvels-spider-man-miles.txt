  The Inspirations, Relationships, And Story Of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales






            Whether it's Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, or Miles Morales, what it means to be a family has always been a huge influence on the web-slingers of New York City. It is that deeply tied connection between characters that is a tradition Insomniac Games has no intention of breaking. Sitting down with Ben Arfmann, lead writer, and Evan Narcisse, narrative consultant, it becomes clear right away that these two understand how that narrative pillar molds Miles himself.

But it isn't just family that drives New York's newest wall-crawler, but one of the neighborhoods itself. Join us as we sit down with key members of the incredibly talented writing team from Insomniac to discuss the inspirations, relationships, and story of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales!

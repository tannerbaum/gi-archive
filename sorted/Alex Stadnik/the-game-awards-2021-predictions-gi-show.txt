            The Game Awards 2021 Predictions

            It's that wonderful time of year again, folks. Canada's favorite son Geoff Keighley graces the stage to host the annual Game Awards ceremony next week. This year, gaming's biggest award show is back to in-person (try to spot Brian Shea in the crowd) and promising a huge night. To get hyped for this year's show, we assembled an expert panel of futurists, including Dan, Kim, and Marcus, to go over our predictions and tell you exactly who's going to win the big awards. Not only that, we end the segment with our wild guesses on what spicy reveals the night will contain. Will there be a new Splinter Cell announced? Could we see updates from huge Microsoft titles such as Avowed or Fable? Is this the night In The Valley Of Gods makes its triumphant return? Only time will tell, but we hope you all can enjoy this fun podcast discussion in the meantime.

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            Join us on another hilarious round of listener questions where the crew sits down to discuss their favorite seasonal video game memories and what the best jaw-dropping moments are!

Read their questions below, or submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

Do you folks have video games tied together in your memories with specific parts of the year? For me, Mortal Kombat is forever tied with Christmas ever since I got MK2 for Genesis as a Xmas gift as a wee young Buel. Thanks! - Bob Buel (discord)

What is the most jaw-dropping moment you can remember while playing a game? For me, playing through Uncharted 2 for the first time was just that the entire way through from the very beginning with the train wreck. - One Mean Leafeon Machine (discord)

            The MultiVersus closed-alpha is finally upon us, and fans have been clamoring to know how some of their favorite characters actually handle when they're out on the battlefield. Join us today as we're showing off three of the game's biggest names and how their move sets work in this promising new platform brawler!

            Harley Quinn

            Daddy's Little Monster Is Here To Cause Trouble

            Harley Quinn has had a pretty remarkable rise these last few years. Whether it's on the silver screen or a home console, it seems the "reformed" doctor is everywhere, including in MultiVersus. Harley is considered an Assassin in the game's meta and backs that classification up with her quick strikes and agile abilities. She can dodge while shooting, lands a few mean shots with her bat, and dashes away, all while never taking a hit when used correctly. She has a nice balance of speed, power, and vertical ability and definitely is one of the highlights of our time with the closed-alpha.

            Batman

            The Caped Crusader Crushes

            Speaking of iconic DC characters, what would a WB brawler look like without Batman? The Dark Knight is what fans would hope for. Not only is he voiced by the legend Kevin Conroy, Bruce Wayne's move set feels right at home with what we know about the character. Batman is more gadget focused than some of the other characters in the game, using his Batarang and grappling hook to make up distances quickly and land some powerful hits. Classified as a Bruiser, The Caped Crusader can devastate his opponents and has the perfect uppercut to send foes flying when their damage counter gets a little too high.

            Shaggy

            Is...Shaggy Going Super Saiyan? 

            MultiVersus isn't limited to just DC characters, though. Plenty of other Warner Bros. icons are here as well and one of the highlights is none other than Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. Like Batman, Shaggy is classified as a Bruiser and excels at landing heavy physical attacks. What's more, he can also charge up in a way that would make Goku feel like he's looking in a mirror to land a powerful special move that can send opponents flying in the right circumstances. I never knew I needed a battle between one of my favorite cartoon characters and the most powerful Saiyan in the universe, but here we are, I guess.

            If all that sounds like something you'd enjoy, you're in luck, as Game Informer has you covered. Be sure to read up on John Carson's written preview, watch our latest episode of New Gameplay Today, and listen to this week's episode of The GI Show for more on our impressions of our time with the closed-alpha! MultiVersus doesn't have a release date quite yet, but there will be plenty of opportunities to test it out when the game's alpha and beta come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this year.

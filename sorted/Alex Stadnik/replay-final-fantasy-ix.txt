  Replay — Final Fantasy IX






            On a day that many thought would never come, Final Fantasy VII Remake has finally arrived. To celebrate this monumental occasion, we figured it fitting to look back at this illustrious series and play another beloved entry in Final Fantasy IX. Join Andrew Reiner, Kimberley Wallace, and me as we return to Gaia and catch up with Zidane, Vivi, and the rest of the crew in this JRPG classic.

We went live earlier but you can catch the full archive above. If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Replay – Castle Crashers






            With the announcement of Alien Hominid Invasion, The Behemoth is back and we couldn't think of a better way to celebrate than by playing the studio's most iconic game. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, Joe Juba, and myself as we bungle our way through Castle Crasher's chaotic four-player co-op mode.

We went live earlier today, but you can still find the archive of the show above! If you can't get enough of Replay and our other shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Replay – The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion






            With the buzz of last night's Xbox Series X announcement, we thought it fitting to bring you back to one of the games that put the Xbox 360 on the map: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

Naturally, we also found it fitting to play it on a PlayStation 3 for some reason. Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, intern Nick Straub, and me as we bumble around Tamriel, recreate your favorite scenes from The Fugitive, and try our best to cause as much chaos as possible.

Thanks again for your patience. We hope to go live next week for another episode of Replay at 2 PM Central. Until then, be sure to subscribe over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to get notified when we go live next!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

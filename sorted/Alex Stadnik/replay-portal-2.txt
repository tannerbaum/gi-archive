  Replay — Portal 2






            Greetings test subject community member! We are thrilled to have you join us for an adventure through the sparkling Aperture Science laboratories for the glory of all things science! We demand encourage your participation as Andrew Reiner, Brian Shea, and I explore Portal 2 and put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.

We went live earlier, but you can catch the full stream archive above! If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

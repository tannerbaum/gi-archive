  Replay — Halo 2






            In Halo: Combat Evolved, Bungie proved to the world that a console first-person shooter could not only work, but could elevate the medium past what many thought possible. In Halo 2, the team refined that formula and produced one of the greatest shooters of all-time.

Join Andrew Reiner, Brian Shea, Matt Miller, and me as we revel in the swelling score from Marty O'Donnell and his amazing team, bask in the glow of the energy sword, and play one of the best multiplayer matches you'll ever lay eyes on at the end of the show.

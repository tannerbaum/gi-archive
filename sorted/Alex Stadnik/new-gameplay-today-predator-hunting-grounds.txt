  New Gameplay Today — Predator: Hunting Grounds






            The Predator. One of the universe's greatest hunters, a true apex lifeform, and one ugly... you know the rest. Developer IllFonic, known for its work on the Friday the 13th game, has released another asymmetrical 4v1 multiplayer experience and we're going hunting. Join Andrew Reiner, Brian Shea, Jeff Cork, Ben Reeves, and me as we play private matches of Predator: Hunting Grounds and prove who the top GI hunter is, once and for all.

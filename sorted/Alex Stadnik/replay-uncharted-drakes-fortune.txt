  Replay — Uncharted: Drake's Fortune






            For many years, Naughty Dog was known for the goofy fun of Crash Bandicoot and the sci-fi platforming of Jak and Daxter. But then in 2007, that all changed with the debut of Nathan Drake. Join Andrew Reiner and me as we do our best Indiana Jones impression and play Uncharted: Drake's Fortune live with the community.

We went live earlier, but you can still catch the full archive above. If you can't get enough Replay and our other shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

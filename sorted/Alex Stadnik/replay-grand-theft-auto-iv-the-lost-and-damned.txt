  Replay – Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost And Damned






            For years, fans have been clamoring for new single-player DLC to come to Grand Theft Auto V, unfortunately to no avail. Even though this may not be exactly the remedy the GTA fan base needs, allow us to soothe some of your pain by taking you back to a time when Rockstar was releasing some of the finest DLC on the market. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, and I as we take up the mantle of Johnny Klebitz of The Lost Motor Club and cause some chaos in Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned.

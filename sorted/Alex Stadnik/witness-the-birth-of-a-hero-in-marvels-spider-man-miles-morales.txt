  Witness The Birth Of A Hero In Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales






            We know that Peter Parker is about as capable as it gets in Insomniac Games' vision of our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. But even the best need help from time to time. That's where Miles Morales comes in. 

Join us as we sit down with Brian Horton, creative director at Insomniac Games, to discuss the moment Miles steps up and becomes his own version of Spider-Man when Peter needs him most.

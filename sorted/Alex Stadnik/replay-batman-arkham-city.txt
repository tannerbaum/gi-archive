  Replay — Batman: Arkham City






            At one point, comic book games were reserved for lackluster movie tie-ins and the occasional hidden gem. Rocksteady's Arkham series changed all that by telling a mature story centered on Bruce Wayne and company, and revolutionizing the way we play as our favorite caped crusaders. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, Jeff Cork, and me as we explore the grimy yet glowing streets of Gotham in Batman: Arkham City.

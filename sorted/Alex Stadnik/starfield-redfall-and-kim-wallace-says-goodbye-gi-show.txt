            Topic Of The Show Part 1:

            Kim Wallace Says Goodbye/Summer Game Fest Reactions

            After a decade of some of the best written work in the industry, KStar is finally leaving Game Informer. The crew asks her about her favorite cover stories she ever wrote, her favorite ice cream flavor, and what she takes the most pride in from her time at GI. As for where she's going next, you'll just have to listen to the show to find out.

After that, Shea, Marcus, Stadnik, and Van Aken detail their trip to Los Angeles to cover Summer Game Fest 2022. They chat about what their favorite games were, the best moments from L.A., and how they already miss podcasting in person.

            Topic Of The Show Part 2:

            Xbox and Capcom Showcase Reactions

            The last few days have been some of the busiest in the industry. On Sunday, Microsoft took the digital stage to reveal what the next 12 months will look like for Xbox fans. The panel is here to discuss the biggest highlights from the stream, including their thoughts on Starfield, Redfall, and more. They then move to Capcom's stream and basically spend the entire time gushing over Resident Evil 4 and the upcoming DLC for Village.

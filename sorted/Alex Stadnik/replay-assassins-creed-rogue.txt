  Replay – Assassin's Creed Rogue






            Assassin's Creed Rogue occupies an odd space in the long-running Ubisoft franchise. The nineth best AC game retreads familiar territory to anyone who's taken up the mantle of Edward Kenway but throws in the interesting twist of hunting assassin's instead of templars.

Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, and me as we take this journey together and return to a time before the series changed into the sprawling RPG it is today.

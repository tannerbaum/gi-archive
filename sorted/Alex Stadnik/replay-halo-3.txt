  Replay — Halo 3






            Whether it was the years of anticipation generated from one of the biggest cliff hanger endings of all-time, the excitement for a then next-generation Bungie game, or the return of the assault rifle, Halo 3 was a cultural event that few games had ever matched in 2007.

Luckily for fans of the iconic series, the prerelease hype wasn't overstated as the game's campaign was a true spectacle with a multiplayer suite that engrossed players for years to come. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, and me as we take the fight back to the Covenant and see how Halo 3 holds up 13 years later.

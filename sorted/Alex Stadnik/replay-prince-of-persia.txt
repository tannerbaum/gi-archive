  Replay - Prince of Persia






            When you ask Ubisoft fans what games they'd love to see return one day, chances are that more UbiArt the Prince of Persia series falls somewhere on their list. While 2008's rendition wasn't everyone's cup of tea, the reboot is remembered for its gorgeous stylized graphics and satisfying traversal that the series is known for.

Join Andrew Reiner, new hire Jason Guisao, and me as we return to the stylish sands of 2008's Prince of Persia.

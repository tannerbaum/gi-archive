  Replay - Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne






            While developer Remedy has moved on to new franchises such as Control, many fans will point to Max Payne as the series that made them fall in love with the Finnish developer. The games became synonymous with the action genre in the early 2000's and Payne's bullet-time ability is still a staple used in modern titles.

Join Andrew Reiner, Brian Shea, and me as we bring the payne load up and return to one of Remedy's most underappreciated gems in Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.

  Replay – Brütal Legend and The Turkey of Christmas Past






            Still craving a wholesome helping of turkey after the holiday? Prefer Black Sabbath over Black Friday? Well, you're in for a treat this week. 

First up on Replay, Andrew Reiner and the gang bring you a holiday classic in the gaming stylings of The Turkey of Christmas Past. Staring Tom de Cat, our furry friend must face off against his ferocious feathered foes before they ruin Christmas.

Later, we dive into Double Fine's underappreciated gem, Brütal Legend, and blast our way through its timeless metal hellscape while slaying every demon in sight.

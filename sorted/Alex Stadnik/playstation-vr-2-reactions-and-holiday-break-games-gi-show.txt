            Topic Of The Show:

            Holiday Break Games

            Ah, the holidays. A time for family, relaxing, and playing video games until your eyes bleed. The latter is exactly what the panel did in the waning days of 2021, and today we're catching you up on all the titles that graced our consoles and PCs. Did we clean up some of our 2021 leftovers such as Halo Infinite? Or did we do our homework and prepare for some of the biggest sequels launching later this year? Or did we say screw all that and just play more Hades and Animal Crossing? You'll just have to tune in to find out.

Spoilers: One of us played a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn, and if you're excited about Guerrilla Games' sequel, check out our cover story here.

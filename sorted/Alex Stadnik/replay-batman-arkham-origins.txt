  Replay - Batman: Arkham Origins






            The Batman Arkham series is widely regarded as one of the best collections of superhero games on the market today. The series' slick combat, engaging detective mode, and loving homage to what came before it made the games a must play for those who loved the Caped Crusader. While Batman: Arkham Origins doesn't quite hit the mark of the mainline trilogy, there's still plenty to love about the Christmas tale of Joker and the Bats' fateful first meeting.

Join Andrew Reiner and me as we dawn the cowl and fight not only for Bruce Wayne's life, but the fate of Gotham as well in Batman: Arkham Origins.

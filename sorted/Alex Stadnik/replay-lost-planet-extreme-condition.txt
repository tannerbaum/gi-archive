  Replay — Lost Planet: Extreme Condition






            Back in 2007, Capcom took us into deep space in the hopes of finding a new world to settle in Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. Stop me if you've heard this one before, but when humans reached their new chilly home on E.D.N. III, it didn't exactly welcome them with open arms, or alien claws in this case. Join Jeff Cork, Ben Reeves, Andrew Reiner, and me as we flatten the Akrid scourage and try to stay alive on this frozen hellscape of a planet.

We went live earlier, but you can catch the full archive in the video above! If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

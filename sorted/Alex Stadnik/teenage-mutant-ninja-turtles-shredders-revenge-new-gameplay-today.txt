While 2022 has seen plenty of gigantic hits in the video games space, there are still plenty of titles we are excited to play. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is one of those hotly-anticipated games. We're giving you a look at the first two levels and breaking down our hands-on impressions on this episode of New Gameplay Today!

Join your hosts, Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart, as they take you through developer Tribute Games' latest title! In the first level, Marcus has selected his favorite turtle, Donatello, to show off the game's gorgeous pixel art and demonstrate why the purple turtle has always been a favorite.

As we continue to the second level, we switch to Raphael and go in-depth on the different character's movesets and discuss how to utilize the super attacks and the environment around the player. Of course, what would a tour of Shredder's Revenge be without a few boss fights? We're also taking down two of the game's opening big bads to round out our time with the turtles. We also answer the important questions in life, such as what iteration of the show is the best and whether or not liking Mikey is basic.

If you're excited about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, be sure to check out Marcus' new written preview to tide you over until the game's summer 2022 release window for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

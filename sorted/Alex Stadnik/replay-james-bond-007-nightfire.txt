  Replay – James Bond 007: Nightfire






            In another universe, fans of Ian Fleming's super spy would be only a week away from James Bond's first on-screen adventure since 2015. But unfortunately, we're not in that world but we can take solace in the fact that there are plenty of other, often hilarious, video game options for people to fill their time. Enter James Bond 007: Nightfire, an original story following Pierce Brosnan's Bond as he tries to save the world from nuclear destruction. Join Andrew Reiner, Brian Shea, and me as we try to conquer not only the nefarious ne'er-do-wells of Nightfire but the control scheme as well.

We went live earlier, but you can catch the full archive of the stream above. If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  Replay — Mass Effect






            From its exhilarating narrative, ruthless villain, and ridiculous iconic elevator rides, Mass Effect hit the ground running in 2007 and continued to bolster Bioware's reputation as the premier western RPG studio. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, and me as we aspire to the status of Spectre and save the galaxy from the sinister Saren in the original Mass Effect.

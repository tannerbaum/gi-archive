            Game of the Year 2021 and Editor Top 10s Part 1

            It's that glorious time of year again when we get to sit down and celebrate the best of the best in the industry. 2021 was anything but ordinary, but it still produced some amazing gaming experiences, and today we're recapping our official top ten list and letting you know what won our Game of the Year. We also want to take some time over the next few weeks to give each editor a chance to spotlight their own lists. Today's episode features the Alexes, Jill, and John talking about their love for Metroid Dread, Life is Strange, and so much more. If you enjoyed this chat, be sure to tune in over the next few weeks as we highlight more top tens from the rest of the editorial staff!

            The Playlist:

            Game Informer Staff discuss the games they're playing.

            After weeks of chaos, we're finally returning to The Playlist! The GI crew has been hard at work checking out some of 2022's most interesting titles. Jill sticks with us here to talk about her time previewing Forspoken, Square Enix's new action title that has a lot going for it, but also a lot to prove before it releases in May of next year. Stadnik later chimes in with his thoughts on his hands-on time with Sifu, developer Sloclap's exciting new action game. With masterful melee combat, slick style, and an interesting aging mechanic, it has instantly shot up his most anticipated list for 2021, and is excited to share his experience with you! Finally, John Carson wraps up the segment with his thoughts on his time with Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker and discusses why the month and a half long grind has been worth it to see all the new content!

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            This week's Listener Questions kicks off with a different segment. We're bringing Marcus, Dan, and Kim back to recap the winner of our Game Awards predictions we did a few weeks ago. Who reigns supreme, and who is looking forward to next year? You'll just have to tune in to find out. After that, we answer your burning questions of what bosses made us throw a controller, whether or not we like the end-of-year recaps, and what we thought of the year in games!

Read their questions below, or submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

I’m curious what bosses in games have caused y’all to cry in frustration or scream with rage? Which have absolutely murdered you? - CaseyDavid (Discord)

Are you Stat people? I ask because I like to get those end of the year wrap ups like spotify does with your music and I just got my Nintendo stats for the year. Always enjoy looking back on that kind of info. Keep up the great work love the show! - Kody Gipson (Discord)

With Game Awards behind us, what’s your retrospective on this year in games as well as this year’s award show? - BigSliceGaming (Discord)

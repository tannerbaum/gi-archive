            Darkest Dungeon 2 is out in early access, and it's making waves here at Game Informer. Join Dan Tack as he breaks down his time with developer Red Hook Studios' ambitious sequel to the 2015 grotesque indie gem. We talk about the highs and lows of the experience thus far and chat about why fans should give the game a try even if they usually don't play titles in early access.

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            This week's selection of listener questions goes entirely off the rails, as the crew discusses what classes they'd be if the GI team were in an RPG, what games we'd give out for Halloween, and what three gaming wishes we have.

Read their questions below, or submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

Hello everyone at Game Informer. First of all, thanks for always giving me a podcast to listen to. So many of a certain age remember the game genie, right? Well, let's say you're cleaning one and find an old one. When you dust it off, an actual genie pops out. It tells you "I am the mighty gaming genie! I can grant any three gaming wishes," so if you had any three gaming wishes, what would they be and why? #bigmanswag - Mike Boyle (Email)

 If GI was an RPG, what kind of character would you be? Class/stats/specials/tropes etc. Dan Tack we already know is canonically a mage, but what else we got? - Crayter (discord)

If you had enough money to hand out game codes for Halloween, what game would you choose to give out? - BiscuitsWithDavey (Discord)

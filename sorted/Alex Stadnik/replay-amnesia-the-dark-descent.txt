  Replay – Amnesia: The Dark Descent






            With Halloween nearly upon us, we at Game Informer are getting in the holiday spirit by highlighting some of the spookier games we've had the displeasure of playing!

That trend continues on this episode of Replay as we delve into the disturbing depths of Frictional Games' original Amnesia: The Dark Descent! Join Andrew Reiner, Dan Tack, Jeff Cork, and me as we brave its twisted horrors and try to keep each other sane.

We had to prerecord this week, but we'll be back for another fun episode next Friday! If you can't get enough of our shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

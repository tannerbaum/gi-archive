  Replay – Metal Wolf Chaos XD






            Allow us to take you back. Back to a simpler time. A time where mechs walked American soil and protected the country from threats domestic and foreign. A time where From Software had yet to light a bonfire. On this week's episode of Replay, Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, and Jeff Cork take you back to the campy classic that is Metal Wolf Chaos XD. Later in the episode, the chat decides it's seen enough and roulettes its way into Fracture from Lucasarts.

We were live earlier today but be sure to check out the stream archive above. You can also subscribe to the show over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to be notified whenever we go live! Thanks for watching and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

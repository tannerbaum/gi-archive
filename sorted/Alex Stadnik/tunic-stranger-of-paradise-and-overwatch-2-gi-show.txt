  Tunic, Stranger Of Paradise, And Overwatch 2 | GI Show






            Welcome to the most chaotic episode of The Game Informer Show in 2022. Join us on today's show, where we're breaking down our glowing review thoughts on Tunic, trying to make sense of Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, and gauging our hype levels on Overwatch 2. If that's not enough, we finish off the pod with another fun edition of Listener Questions, where we finally go over our favorite (or least favorite) nightmares.

It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on "violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws," specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

            Topic Of The Show:

            Is Tunic The Next Great Indie Game?

            For over half a decade, many have followed the development of Tunic with bated breath, hoping for a new exciting indie to live up to its large amount of potential. But after years worth of delays and quick demos, many wondered what the finished product would be. Well, Tunic is finally here, and according to our own Jill Grodt, it's one people should get excited about. Join us as we discuss why the Finji published gem is a fantastic ride filled with discovery and intense combat and why our new favorite fox actually shares some ties with a little game called Elden Ring.

            Game Informer Staff discuss the games they're playing.

            We promise we don't make too many chaos jokes when talking about Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, but we do have to indulge a little bit, right? The EIC Andrew Reiner makes a rare appearance to talk about the bizarre entry in the iconic series from Square Enix. We're breaking down the highs of the game's combat, the lows of Final Fantasy Origin's story, and tell you whether or not it's worth picking up. Also, of course, we talk about Elden Ring because we can't stop playing it. If it makes you feel any better, Marcus has a great analogy about how the game is kind of an experience akin to Dragon Ball of all things. You'll just have to tune in to hear more.

Hey GI Crew, since Alex asks every time, I figured I'd finally ask. What is a nightmare that you've had recently or have never forgotten? I had a nightmare in high school where I woke up without arms in a hospital bed, and I couldn't get up. I could see the stubs of my elbows and feel my fingers moving. I practically woke up crying - Derek

Hello everyone! What are some of your favorite scary moments in games? What moments have kept you up at night after you stopped playing a game? - CaseyDavid

            Horizon Forbidden West Cover Reveal

            Horizon Forbidden West is this month's cover story and we're going big on today's episode of the podcast. Join the Alexes as they bring on Kimberely "Kstar" Wallace and Marcus Stewart to regale us about the time they spent with developer Guerrilla Games! The two go over all the new features they saw, including discussions of the new mechanical monstrosities Aloy will be fighting, what's going on since the original game, and so much more. We also go over the game's new crafting system and how it weaves more heavily into the different armor Aloy will dawn in Forbidden West. If you're excited about Guerrilla's next game, this is one you won't want to miss!

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            We've got a festive round of Listener Questions for your enjoyment, and this week we're chopping it up about what games we'd give loved ones for Christmas and what our favorite holiday memory entails.

Read their questions below, or submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

Hey GI crew! With Christmas almost here, what game from this year would you gift, and why? Was it your favorite game of the year, or a more meaningful/ emotional game, or one you think everyone should play and experience? - AFireOutside (Discord)

What was your favorite video game-related Christmas/holiday gift? I was a wee lad when I got a Game Informer with X-Men Legends inside it. I played that game for years and still have some of my favorite co-op game memories. - Derek (discord)

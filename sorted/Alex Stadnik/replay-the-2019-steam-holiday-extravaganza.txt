  Replay – The 2019 Steam Holiday Extravaganza






            The holiday season. A joyous time of year where friends and family congregate to be together, slay hoards of snowmen, and save Krampus from a group of treacherous elves. Join Andrew Reiner, Ben Reeves, Jeff Cork, and I as we play through some of the most random holiday Steam games we could get our hands on.

And with that, Replay is done for the year. Thank you so much to everyone who's supported the show throughout the years. From the diehards who are with us every week in the chat to the people who've only tuned in once, you guys make this show special and we are so excited for another year of making ridiculous content for you.

Next week we'll be back on the regular Friday schedule at 2 p.m. Central. You can also subscribe to the show over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to be notified whenever we go live! Thanks for watching, and happy holidays!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

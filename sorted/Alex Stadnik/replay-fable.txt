  Replay — Fable






            At one time not long ago, Fable was synonymous with video game excellence and was a staple of Microsoft's first-party lineup. While I pray those days return soon, Fable fans such as myself still have the old games to look back on for a shot of quirky British humor, simple and fun combat, and the amazing fantasy world of Albion. Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, Ben Reeves and me as we return to Fable and rediscover what made this fantasy world so enticing.

We went live earlier today, but be sure to check out the archive of the stream above. If you can't get enough Replay and our other shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

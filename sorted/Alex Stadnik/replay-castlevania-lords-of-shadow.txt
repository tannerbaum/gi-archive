  Replay — Castlevania: Lords of Shadow






            When people mention Castlevania, they usually think about the classic 2D adventures that spawned a completely new genre of games (well half of one, at least. I see you Metroid fans). In 2010 though, Konami wanted to buck that trend and bring its vampire-slaying franchise into a new era. Thus, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow was born. The game focused on Gabriel Belmont and his buddy Patrick Stewert Zobek as they try and save the world from the evil Lords of Shadow in the gameplay stylings of the early God of War games.

Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, and me as we return to this Kojima Productions vision of the classic Castlevania franchise.

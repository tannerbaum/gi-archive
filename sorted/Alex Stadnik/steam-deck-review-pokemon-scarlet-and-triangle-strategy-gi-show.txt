            Topic Of The Show:

            Does The Steam Deck Deserve The Hype?

            While gigantic game releases have dominated 2022, Valve is also hoping to leave its mark on the industry with the Steam Deck, the publisher's answer to the Nintendo Switch. The portable PC presents a plethora of possibilities, and today we're chatting with the one and only Matt Miller to find out if it hits the mark. We dive into all the games we played on the Steam Deck, discuss the battery, and talk about whether or not aspiring early adopters should wait for the kinks to be worked out.

            Game Informer Staff discuss the games they're playing.

            Believe it or not, there are games outside of Elden Ring available soon, and good ones at that! We kick off the proceedings with KStar's early review impressions of Triangle Strategy and discuss why she thinks people shouldn't sleep on Square Enix's gorgeous 2D-HD strategy game for the Nintendo Switch. Next up, Stadnik got to go hands-on with Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and has good news for fans of all things Borderlands. Finally, we round out this fun segment with Fines' thoughts on Horizon Forbidden West and his quest to actually find a PlayStation 4 copy.

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            We got more Listener Questions to answer, and this week we discuss what our most desired Steam Deck game is and play a brand new game sent in by a beautiful community member!

Read this week's questions below and submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

What game are you looking forward to the most playing on the Steam Deck, and why is it Lost Ark? - Zach Pligge (Discord)

I have a game for you all! It's always interesting to see alternative names for video games in other regions. With that in mind, I put together a list of games with alternative titles outside of the US. The game is simple - The host reads the alternative title to the panel. Then the panel has to guess between the options (A-C multiple choice) to match the alternate title to the US release. - Wes Bates (Email)

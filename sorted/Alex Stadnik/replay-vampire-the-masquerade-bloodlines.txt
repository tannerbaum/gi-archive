  Replay - Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines






            Throughout the year, publisher Paradox Interactive has been slowly lifting the curtain on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and getting fans excited about what's coming next in the series. But today, we're taking you back to the spooky streets of Los Angeles and showing off where the series began with the original 2004 entry.

Join Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, and me as we sharpen our fangs and dive back into Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.

We went live earlier but you can catch the full archive of the stream above! If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

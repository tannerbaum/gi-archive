  Replay — The Witcher: Enhanced Edition






            After the success of The Witcher 3 and subsequent Netflix series, Geralt and company have become icons of the industry. But back in 2007, CD Projekt Red was just getting started with The Witcher world and cutting its teeth on telling the story of this rich and darkly woven tale.

Join Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, and me as we take you back to where it all began and experience Gerlat's first appearance in the gaming landscape with The Witcher: Enhanced Edition.

  Replay – Bioshock Infinite Part 2: Return To Columbia






            On last week's show, we took fans on a ride through Columbia and reintroduced them to twisted world of Bioshock Infinite. Unfortunately in that time, we couldn't reach Elizabeth, the catalyst for both gameplay and story, thus not showing off the breadth of what Irrational Games' sequel had to offer. That changes today as we're jumping back on the sky rails once more!

Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, Jeff Cork, and me as we discuss Columbo, the best companion characters in video games, and violently try to steal hats from NPCs in our return to Bioshock Infinite.

We had to prerecord this week's show, but we'll be back in seven days with another fun episode! If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

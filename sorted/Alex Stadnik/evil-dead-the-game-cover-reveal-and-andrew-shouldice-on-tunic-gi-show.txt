            Topic Of The Show Part 1:

            Andrew Shouldice On Bringing Tunic To Life

            In a first for the Alex and Alex era of The GI Show, we're bringing Andrew Shouldice, the man behind the creation of Tunic, onto the show to give you the inside scoop on how everyone's favorite new fox came into existence. We also go over what it was like developing the game solo, then with a small team, whether or not people have found all the secrets yet, and his reaction to people thinking the game was canceled in an interview segment you can't miss.

            Topic Of The Show Part 2:

            Evil Dead: The Game Is GI's Next Cover!

            After a long time away, Dan Tack is finally back on the show to report on what he's been working on. Saber Interactive is bringing Ash and company back, and Tack has the inside scoop on all of it. Join us as we discuss our hands-on impressions of Evil Dead: The Game, how we think it lives up to other asymmetric titles, and whether or not we believe fans of the series will enjoy their time in this haunting world.

            The Playlist:

            Game Informer Staff discuss the games they're playing.

            The GI squad has also been busy outside of Evil Dead and Tunic. Jill kicks things off with her preview impressions of MythForce, an exciting new rogue-lite that fans of 1980s cartoons will definitely be interested in. Then, Marcus regales us with his time on vacation and updates us on his time playing Norco, a poignant point-and-click adventure that our own Jason Guisao thinks is a GOTY contender. After that, Shea gives us his thoughts on MLB The Show 22 and his poor Baltimore Orioles, and Tack finishes things off with a chat about Hunt: Showdown and late 1800s weaponry. If that doesn't sound like the most fun you could have with a podcast, I don't know what to tell you.

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            This week's Listener Questions provide banger after banger, as we answer more questions on Evil Dead: The Game, discuss the industry's knack for copying from other developers, and whether or not the Wii U deserves to be called "despised."

Read this week's questions below and submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

I'm a huge Evil Dead fan and though I had some fun with the Friday the 13th game it was nothing that I felt I wanted to play regularly. Are there any hooks in Evil Dead that will keep players around for a while? Does any of the single-player content seem worthwhile? - Greencapt (Discord)

Where does the GI cast fall when it comes to games shamelessly copying one another? Art imitates art, but when would a patent be warranted (like Shadow of War’s nemesis system)? Is it ok as long as the copycat is…better? Examples: - Fortnite copying PUBG’s battle royale system and copying Among Us’ gameplay. - Pretty much everyone copying Breath of the Wild’s glider mechanic. - AnAttackCorgi (Discord)

Before I bought the Switch, my family had the Wii U, with a large collection of games. It’s where I played Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8, and countless other titles that debuted on the console, and that I loved. My question: Why is the Wii U so universally despised, despite delivering us some of the greatest games of all time, if not the GOAT itself? - Pintsizedphysics (Discord)

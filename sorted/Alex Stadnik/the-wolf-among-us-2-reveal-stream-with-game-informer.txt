  The Wolf Among Us 2 Reveal Stream With Game Informer






            The Wolf Among Us is a cult hit amongst fans of developer Telltale Games' distinct form of storytelling. But when the studio ran into financial trouble back in 2018, the world over wasn't sure if they'd see the continued tales of Bigby Wolf. Today fans are in for a treat, though, as we finally get to see what's behind the curtain on The Wolf Among Us 2 as we react live with you on Twitch.

Join Ben Reeves, Alex Stadnik, and Wesley LeBlanc as they partner with Telltale Games and watch the studio's reveal stream today along with the beautiful Game Informer community. We'll be there a little early to discuss why we're excited for the return of the cult classic, what we're hoping to see from the day's events, and get you hyped for the rest of the show. We're going live before the event at 12 p.m. CT, so be sure to join us in the chat for all the fun and let us know what you're excited to see.

  GI Show – E3 2021 Predictions






            It's finally that special time of year again. E3 2021 is in the air and we can't wait to see what some of the biggest names in the video game industry have in store for their legions of fans. But one does not celebrate such an occasion with a casual 15-minute chat.

We dedicated a whole special edition of The GI Show to give our clairvoyant predictions about what the likes of Microsoft, Nintendo, and more have to surprise us when E3 (and Geoff Keighley) open their digital doors to the masses. Will we see anything from huge tentpoles such as The Elder Scrolls VI or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2? What will PlayStation's presence entail? How are we going to contain ourselves when Halo Infinite comes on screen? Only time will tell.

The wait for E3 week (weekend? Month? How do we quantify this anymore?) can be excruciating, but we have just the remedy to tide you over. Join Alex Stadnik, Liana Ruppert, Marcus Stewart, and new-hire John Carson as they dish on what they think will go down during gaming's biggest events!

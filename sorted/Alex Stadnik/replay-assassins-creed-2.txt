  Replay — Assassin's Creed 2






            It doesn't get much bigger in games than Assassin's Creed and with Valhalla in sight, we thought it fitting to look back at the title that elevated the series into the pillar of the industry it is today. Join Andrew Reiner, Leo Vader, Joe Juba, and me as we hang out with Leonardo Da Vinci and the other cool cats of Renaissance Italy and try to figure out what exactly is going on with Desmond in Assassin's Creed II.

We went live earlier, but you can watch the full archive above. If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

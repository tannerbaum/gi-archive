  Replay — Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal






            Just like some of the other great developers under the Sony umbrella, Insomniac has turned into a powerhouse studio that has evolved throughout its 26 years of existence. But that evolution wouldn't have been possible without the help of a furry lombax and his mechanical mate.

Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, and me as we take you back to Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal and discuss why a certain executive editor has stated that Insomniac's series can go toe-to-toe with a Nintendo giant. You'll also want to stick around until the end of the episode, where we Roulette our way into the zany antics of Britain's greatest super-spy.

This week's show had to be prerecorded, but we'll be back next week for more. If you're wanting some live content, though, be sure to check out our community stream where we play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with you! If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

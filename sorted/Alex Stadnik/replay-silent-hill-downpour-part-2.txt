  Replay – Silent Hill: Downpour Part 2






            While Silent Hill: Downpour may not be the most beloved entry in the franchise, it's sure struck a chord with our audience. Join us this week as we continue our trek through fog, spooky screaming ladies, wild pizza toppings, and even more fog. Also, be sure to check out part one of the series as well.

We went live earlier today but be sure to check out the archive of the stream above! Subscribe over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Enjoy the show!

            The Callisto Protocol Exclusive Cover Discussion

            We've revealed the latest GI cover, and we think horror fans are in for a treat. Join Shea and Stadnik as they break down their time seeing The Callisto Protocol and talking with the dev team at Striking Distance Studios. We kick off the segment detailing some of the game's story and talking about what new protagonist Jacob is up against on Jupiter's scariest moon. We then discuss the game's multiple combat systems, including the tantalizing dance of the unique dodging system combined with ranged and melee attacks. Is The Callisto Protocol going to live up to horror fans' lofty expectations? Time will tell, but we hope today's segment will make the wait a little easier.

            Summer Game Fest Predictions

            What's Showing Up At Geoff Keighley's Big Show?

            Over the last few weeks, we've predicted what some of the biggest publishers in the world have up their sleeves during this exciting time of year. On this week's show, the spotlight shifts to Summer Game Fest, and let me tell you, we have some wild predictions. Carson and Reiner join us for the fun and bring the heat with predictions on Gears 6, Resident Evil 4 Remake, and so much more. With points and pride on the line, who's picks will prove correct? Only time will tell.

            Listener Questions:

            The Game Informer crew answers your burning questions.

            We can honestly say that this week's Listener Questions is one of the sillier ones we've had in a minute. Join the crew as they answer your questions on what we're excited to see at Summer Game Fest, does Geoff Keighley age, and how we interact with...babies?

Read this week's questions below and submit your own via the Official Game Informer Community Discord or by emailing us at Podcast@GameInformer.com:

In public, what's your policy on baby interaction??? (Baby being defined here as a 5-10-month-old.) Children that age has a tendency to stare (often when the parents are looking elsewhere) and I'm a sucker for those fat little chibi humans. Do you make faces? Wave? Smile? Or the ultimate baby-flex. . . Peek-a-boo. I've been caught numerous times playfully making faces at other people's babies and my response is always the same: "THEY started it. Tell your kid to stop picking face-fights with me." So when it comes to babies, what are YOUR rules of engagement? Love always. - Dayron from Fort Lauderdale, Fl

Probably the single most important question: Does Geoff Keighley age? - Legend of Gamer102

This probably got asked already, but of the publishers announced to be partnered up with SGF, which ones are you most excited for and why? - BigSliceGaming

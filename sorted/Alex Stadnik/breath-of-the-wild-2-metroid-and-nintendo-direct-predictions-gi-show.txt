  Breath Of The Wild 2, Metroid, and Nintendo Direct Predictions | GI Show






            Welcome back to a new episode of The Game Informer Show! We know what you're thinking, and yes, we are aware that Nintendo just put on a Xenoblade 3 digital showcase, but that won't stop us from hoping for more. Just like with Sony and Microsoft, we're brushing off our crystal balls and predicting what Nintendo will have at its big summer Direct...whenever that may be.

Will The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's sequel make an appearance with a more concrete gameplay section and a name reveal? Will Nintendo continue to roll out its iconic characters on Switch with a new Donkey Kong game? Can we expect to see Samus in the form of the rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy port or the much-anticipated Metroid Prime 4? Only time will tell, but we hope today's podcast will be a fun distraction while we wait for the next big Nintendo Direct!

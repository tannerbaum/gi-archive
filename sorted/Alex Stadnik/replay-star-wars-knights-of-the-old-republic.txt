  Replay – Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic






            Ladies and gentlemen, with the recent releases of The Mandalorian, Jedi: Fallen Order, and now The Rise of Skywalker, we are fully in the midst of Star Wars season. To celebrate the cosmic fun, Andrew Reiner and the gang take you back to one of the greatest Star Wars games ever created in Knights of the Old Republic.

We'll be back next week with another prerecorded episode for the holidays. You can also subscribe to the show over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to be notified whenever we go live! Thanks for watching, and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

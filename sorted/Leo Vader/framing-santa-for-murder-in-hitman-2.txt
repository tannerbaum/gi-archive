  Framing Santa For Murder In Hitman 2






            Sometimes at Game Informer, we like to completely stop informing and just play games. In this nearly informationless video, Cork joins me as I attempt to become Santa Claus (from Christmas) and kill the Home Alone guys in this limited time bonus mission for Hitman 2, returning from Hitman 2016.

The mission is free for owners of Hitman 2 and can be played until January 8th. You can and should unlock the Santa outfit for permanent use.

Enjoy the video above, and thank you to the entire community for a great year. Happy holidays and I'll see you in 2019!

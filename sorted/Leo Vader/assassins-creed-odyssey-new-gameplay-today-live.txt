  Assassin's Creed Odyssey – New Gameplay Today Live






            "I love New Gameplay Today, but I wish it had a live component!" That's you. Well, we've heard your feedback loud and clear. Today we streamed another upcoming release with Assassin's Creed Odyssey, diving into some of the game's side-content with a mid-game save. We completely avoid spoilers for the game's main path, and just show off the hijinks you can get up to in the game's humongous open world.

You can watch the archive of the stream above, and follow us on YouTube or Twitch to be notified when we go live next, most likely with Black Ops 4!

            .

Tune into New Gameplay Today to see the latest hands-on previews of upcoming titles, as well as first looks at brand new games and popular titles receiving expanded content.

  A Day In The Life Of Grounded






            Grounded, the miniature survival sim from Obsidian Entertainment is Game Informer's latest cover story, and Obsidian has been kind enough to give us extended access to an early build from home. The game has a lot of promise, and we wanted to show off the core, self-driven gameplay that comes once you've spent a few hours getting your tiny feet under you.

So enjoy a taste of Grounded's moment-to-moment gameplay, and come back next week for a look at the game's varied wildlife! For more Grounded, listen to us discuss our gameplay impressions on last week's episode of The Game Informer Show.

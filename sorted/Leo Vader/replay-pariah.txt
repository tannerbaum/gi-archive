  Replay – Pariah






            Today's live episode of Replay proved exciting but problematic. Two of the three titles we played crashed on us, which made for a scattershot but very fun stream. We kicked it off with Pariah, a forgotten shooter from the original Xbox. Reviews of the title were mixed, securing a nice 69 on Metacritic.

Enjoy the episode above! We stream Replay live every Friday at 2 PM Central, so follow us over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to be notified when we go live next!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

  New Gameplay Today – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order






            We got our first taste of Jedi: Fallen Order's gameplay during E3, but today EA is releasing much more footage of that section of the game. Andrew Reiner joins me to check out the AT-AT sequence that precedes what we've seen, followed by a new playthrough of the section shown at E3.

You can find the video without commentary on EA Star Wars' YouTube channel, and be sure to check out the banner below for our nearly-complete hub of exclusive coverage of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order!

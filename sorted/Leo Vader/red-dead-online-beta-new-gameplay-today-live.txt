  Red Dead Online Beta – New Gameplay Today Live






            Of all the mysteries in Red Dead Redemption II, one of the biggest has been the multiplayer. From everything you can do in the open world to how it's being monetized, almost all of it has been kept under wraps by Rockstar.

Today, owners of the Ultimate edition of the game finally get to dig into the online component and answer these questions for themselves. We streamed some gameplay live today, forming a posse and exploring the game!

You can watch the archive from today's stream above, and make sure to follow us on YouTube or Twitch to be notified when we go live next, including streams of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and other anticipated titles as they release!

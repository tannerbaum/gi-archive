  Dreams Beta Dream Surfing – New Gameplay Today Live






            We recently got access to the Dreams Beta, and in the little time I've spent with it, I'm already blown away. The variety and quality of games the community has produced in such a short amount of time has been incredibly impressive, and I can't wait to dive in and play more. So that's what we're gonna do!

Watch the archived stream above and help guide me and Ben Hanson on our adventure through Dreams. Watch the stream on this page here, or join the chat on YouTube or Twitch to make suggestions and chat with us about the wild creations you'd like to see us test drive!

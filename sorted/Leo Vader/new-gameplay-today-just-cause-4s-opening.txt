  New Gameplay Today – Just Cause 4's Opening






            When Just Cause 4 was shown to be about an evil corporation using a weather machine to wreak havoc on the population, it seemed like Avalanche was leaning more into the goofy side with their storytelling. Diving in blind to the campaign here, we learned that a persistent tornado that generates YouTube videos is something to be taken very seriously.

I'm joined by GI interns JP Gemborys and Jill Grodt for a look at the first portion of the game before getting out into the open world. We play with some of the games new toys and talk about issues with the previous entry that seem to be addressed in the new game.

Just Cause 4 releases tomorrow, December 4 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

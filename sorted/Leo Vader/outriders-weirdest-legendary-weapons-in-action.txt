  Outriders’ Weirdest Legendary Weapons In Action






            A loot game is only as good as its loot, so for today's exclusive Outriders video we're showing off three of the game's unique legendaries. Warped by The Anomaly, these almost organic-looking weapons are as fun to look at as they are to play with. Watch the video above for an up close view of three of them, as well as a showcase of the weapons in action.

  Red Dead Redemption II's First Two Hours – New Gameplay Today Live






            Yesterday, we posted a full hour of spoiler-free Red Dead Redemption II gameplay. Today, we did the exact opposite, with a two hour livestream of spoiler-filled gameplay. We played through the opening of the game's massive campaign, which you can read all about in Bertz's review.

You can catch the archive of the stream above, and follow us over on YouTube or Twitch to be notified when we go live next! Make sure to stay tuned throughout the fall for streams of Fallout 76 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as they release!

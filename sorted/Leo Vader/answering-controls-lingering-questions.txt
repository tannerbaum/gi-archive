  Answering Control's Lingering Questions






            We've spent all of March rolling out exclusive features on Control, and as we approach the end it's time to gather questions from the community to help us get the important details we may have missed. For this special episode of The Game Informer Show, we Skype in game director Mikael Kasurinen, narrative director Brooke Maggs, and communications director Thomas Puha to find out about the length of the game, why they went exclusive to Epic on PC, and much more.

You can watch the video above, subscribe and listen to the audio on iTunes or Google Play, listen on SoundCloud, stream it on Spotify, or download the MP3 by clicking here.

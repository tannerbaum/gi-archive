  Kingdom Hearts III – New Gameplay Today Live






            It's hard to believe, but Kingdom Hearts III is actually coming out. Ahead of release on January 29th, we streamed the first two hours of the game, skipping cutscenes for embargo reasons and to avoid spoilers.

Join us for the tearful reunion of Sora, Donald, Goofy and more, with Kingdom Hearts expert Kim Wallace and Sandwich Experts Ben Reeves and I providing commentary and questions from chat. And don't forget to follow us on YouTube or Twitch to be notified when we go live next!

  New Gameplay Today – Return Of The Obra Dinn






            From how much I loved Papers, Please, I knew I would be making time for whatever creator Lucas Pope put out next. I'm happy to say that from my brief time with Return of the Obra Dinn, it's on track to cement itself as a worthy successor, both in terms of narrative and unique gameplay.

Cork and I climb aboard the Obra Dinn and show the basic loop of the game, with possible spoilers for the game's first few mysteries. I say "possible spoilers" because we may have been completely wrong! That's part of the game's charm.

Return of the Obra Dinn releases today on Mac, Windows and Linux.

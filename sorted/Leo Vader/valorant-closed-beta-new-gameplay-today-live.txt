  Valorant Closed Beta – New Gameplay Today Live






            Have you ever wished someone would make Counter Strike: Global Offensive? It's such a great concept for a game, I can't believe no one has made it yet. Well, wait no longer, because Valorant is here!

The game is in closed beta today, and we're showing off what we can of the character-driven shooter. The stream starts at 1 PM Central, and remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, and Facebook to get notified when we go live! Thanks and enjoy the show!

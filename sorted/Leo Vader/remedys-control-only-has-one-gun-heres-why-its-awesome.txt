  Remedy's Control Only Has One Gun. Here's Why It's Awesome






            Guns are kind of the main thing that video game characters hold in their hands, so in our line of work we see a lot of them. But they almost never stick out as much as the Service Weapon in Control, a transforming pistol rooted in the narrative that never leaves your side.

In the video above, lead designer Paul Ehreth and narrative director Brooke Maggs join us to explain the gun's forms, hint at its mysterious origins, and show off exclusive gameplay of the weapon in action.

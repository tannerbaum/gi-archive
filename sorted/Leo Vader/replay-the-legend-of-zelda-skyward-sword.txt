  Replay – The Legend Of Zelda: Skyward Sword






            Though it certainly has its fans, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is considered one of the most poorly received titles in the franchise. Game Informer gave it a 10, and today we're revisiting it on a live episode of Replay to determine who was right and who was wrong, and hopefully even find out if opinions are subjective!

So, watch the episode above for a rousing hour of aimless wandering, unrestrained Groose adoration, and a baffling Ben Reeves moment that left Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, and Leo Vader speechless. We also discuss the hypothetical Zelda games we would make, whether or not Link should have a voice, and (for some reason) Topher Grace. It really is a very special episode, so don't miss it.

And follow us over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to be notified when we go live with our next episode!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

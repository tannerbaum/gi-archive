  Replay – Alpha Protocol






            The Outer Worlds from Obsidian finally releases next week, but it's far from their first attempt at an expansive RPG. On today's new episode of Replay, we're revisiting one of the less remembered titles in their library with Alpha Protocol, an action RPG that's heavy on player choice.

The episode is now archived. You can watch new episodes every Friday at 2pm CT on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

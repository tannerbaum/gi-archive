  Shadow Of The Tomb Raider – New Gameplay Today Live






            The thrills of New Gameplay. The urgency of Today. The long I pronunciation of Live. All these factors will be in our favor as Kim, Suriel and I journey into the first ninety minutes of Shadow Of The Tomb Raider.

The stream is over now but you can watch the archive up above, or follow us on YouTube or Twitch to be notified when we go live next, like when Assassin's Creed: Odyssey launches!

For more Shadow of the Tomb Raider, you can read Kim's review of the game here!

  New Gameplay Today – Code Vein






            Bandai Namco's upcoming Code Vein was affectionately pitched to me as Dark Souls meets God Eater, and since I don't know anything about any of those things, I brought in Dan Tack to chat with Imran Khan about the highs and lows of his time with the game. My understanding is that there are some of each.

For more Code Vein, read Imran's full preview of the game ahead of release sometime in 2019 on Xbox, PS4 and PC.

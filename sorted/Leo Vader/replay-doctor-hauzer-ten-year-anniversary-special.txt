  Replay – Doctor Hauzer (Ten Year Anniversary Special)






            This upcoming Monday marks ten full years of Replay, and we can't think of a better way to celebrate than with a rarely seen 3DO title from the developers behind Overblood. Doctor Hauzer is looking like it'll be the kind of absolute mess that Replay fans have come to expect over our storied history.

We went live earlier today than usual but be sure to check out the archive of the stream above! Be sure to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to get notified when we go live each week! Thanks and enjoy the show!

Every week, Game Informer editors enter the vault and dust off games from every genre and platform imaginable. Watch Replay to relive fond (and not so fond) memories from gaming’s past.

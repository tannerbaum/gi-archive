  The Bug Encyclopedia - Exclusive Grounded Gameplay






            The creatures of modern survival games are pretty well established - rabbits are easy food, bears will chase you down, and so on. With the tiny, backyard world of Grounded, Obsidian has to rewrite the library of animals you're interacting with and make their threat level easily readable. Today I walk you through some of the game's peaceful and hostile critters, in a video that will have you saying, "Honey, I watched the video."

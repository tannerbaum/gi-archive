  Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth Will Have Animal Crossing-Style Minigames






            The upcoming Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will have its own in-game resort island getaway that plays not too dissimilar from the Animal Crossing games. Happy Resort DonDoko Island was shown off today during Xbox's most recent Partner Preview livestream.  

Players will be able to build the island to their liking – including customizing their homes, building infrastructure, and interacting with the island's inhabitants. You can see the mode in action below:

While Infinite Wealth is out on January 26, 2024, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has more games up its sleeve. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a bridge between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza: Like A Dragon, is out this year on November 8. Additionally, back in February, the studio released Like a Dragon: Ishin, a remake of the 2014 game Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, which never came to the States.

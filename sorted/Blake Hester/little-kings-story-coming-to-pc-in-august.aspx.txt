Release
July 21, 2009

Publisher Xseed Games announced today a release date for its 2009 Wii-exclusive game, Little King’s Story, for PC. It will be available on August 5.

The game, which puts players into the little shoes of Corobo who unexpectedly becomes a king, will be on digital storefronts such as Steam, Humble Games, and GOG. It will be 10% off for its first week of release.

Little King’s Story combines real-time strategy elements with life simulation, giving players a kingdom and townspeople to give tasks to. Players will need to control the kingdom of Alpoko, all the while trying to be a just ruler to their subjects.

This re-release will feature updated HD visuals, achievements, and controller support. We reviewed Little King’s Story on the Wii back in 2009, noting that it “flirts with greatness, but is hampered by spotty mechanics.”

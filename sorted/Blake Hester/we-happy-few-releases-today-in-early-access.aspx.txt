We Happy Few is available for Xbox via its Preview program, Steam Early Access, and GOG's Games In Development. For those participating in early access, developer Compulsion Games will be adding content and features, such as expanding the city Wellington
Wells. Players currently have access to some of the game's key mechanics, such as, "social
conformity and suspicion, Joy intake, crafting, combat, and survival," as explained in a press release.

  Pony Island 2 Is The Next Game From The Creator Of Inscryption 






            The next game from acclaimed indie developer Daniel Mullins is Pony Island 2: Panda Circus. Announced during The Game Awards, as you might expect from the creator of Pony Island and Inscryption, we have far more questions than answers.

Here's what we saw: a 3D adventure game that turns into a classic-looking 2D point-and-click adventure game. Voice actor and popular internet guy SungWon "ProZD" Cho is in the game during live-action segments. And a whole host of genre-hopping gameplay. It's a lot. 

Check it out for yourself below:

Pony Island 2: Panda Circus is probably going to be released in 2025 or 2026, but the trailer doesn't make it clear. Mullins is coming off the critically beloved and aforementioned Inscryption – one of our favorite games of 2021.

  Hideo Kojima Is Making A New Game Called OD With Jordan Peele






            Hideo Kojima, the director behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, and Jordan Peele, the director of movies such as Get Out and Nope, are making a new cloud-based project for Xbox Game Studios called OD Announced tonight during The Game Awards, the project also stars Sophia Lillis (It) and Hunter Schafer (Euphoria).

In typical Kojima fashion, the trailer doesn't illuminate much. We see several characters reading (and sometimes failing to do so) a tongue twister before Lillis' character screams in horror at what they see behind a door. 

Talking onstage, Kojima was joined by Peele to mostly compliment each other's work. However, Kojima stressed OD is, in fact, a game. But it's also a movie. And apparently something unlike much else. Or so he says. Peele said it was "crazy." I lost the plot after a while.

Anyways, check it out for yourself:

OD isn't the only project Kojima is working on. His studio, Kojima Productions, is also developing a sequel to Death Stranding.

  Kojima Productions Is Working On A New 'Action Espionage' Game With Sony






            Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an "action espionage" game.

If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline "Tactical Espionage Action." In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. 

Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. 

He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie "in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound," Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to "transcend the barriers between film and video games."

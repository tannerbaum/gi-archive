  Last Sentinel Is A New Triple-A Game From Former Rockstar Devs






            Last Sentinel is a new triple-A open-world game announced at The Game Awards from Lightspeed LA, a Tencent-owned US-based developer. Lightspeed is led by Steve Martin, who previously worked on Rockstar Games and Electronic Arts.

The game was shown off via a cinematic trailer where a young girl and her ostensible cyborg mother are under attack before being saved by a motorcycle-riding hero. The trailer ends by panning up to show a massive cyberpunk city.

  Payday 3 Is Coming Out In September






            At long last, Payday 3 has a release date. Today during the Xbox Games Showcase, it was announced that the multiplayer bank-robber simulator will be coming out on September 21. 

Aside from a date, a flashy new trailer showed plenty of the robbery and action mechanics off. As you might've guessed, it sure does look like another Payday. Check it out below:

Payday 3 was announced all the way back in 2016 and has been stuck in development hell ever since. Apparently, it's set in a "living, enormous representation" of New York City."

  Tekken 8 Gets January Release Date






            Tekken 8 will be released on January 26, 2024, as announced today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live. The game was originally unveiled back in 2022. Alongside the release date, a new single-player mode was announced called Arcade Quest. Players can design their own avatars (which look suspiciously like Miis) and take place in tournaments.

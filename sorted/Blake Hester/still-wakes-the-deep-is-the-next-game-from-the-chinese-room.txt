According to a press release, Still Wakes The Deep puts you in the shoes of an "off-shore oil rig worker, fighting for his life through a vicious storm, perilous surroundings, and the dark, freezing North Sea waters." It's a narrative horror game, a genre The Chinese Room hasn't explored since 2013 with Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.

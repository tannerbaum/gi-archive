  New Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Trailer Shows Vehicles, Homing Arrows, Rail Grinding, And More






            Today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream, the company gave a new look at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.  

You're going to immediately jump past this paragraph to the trailer below, so here are the quick bits you need to know: there's rail grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great.

While we're at it, here's a whole host of new screenshots. 

Tears of the Kingdom will be released on May 12, 2023.

  Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Is Coming Next Summer






            Luigi's Mansion 2 will be released on the Nintendo Switch as the aptly titled Luigi's Mansion 2 HD sometime next summer, Nintendo announced today during its most recent Direct Livestream.

For the most part, it seems to be largely the same game you played back on the Nintendo 3DS – albeit with much better graphics. We got a first look at gameplay today, too, which you can see in the full trailer below.

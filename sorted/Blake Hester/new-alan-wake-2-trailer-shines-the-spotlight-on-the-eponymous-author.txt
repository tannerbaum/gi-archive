  New Alan Wake 2 Trailer Shines The Spotlight On The Eponymous Author






            Today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live, we got a new look at the gameplay and live-action scenes in the upcoming Alan Wake 2. The trailer begins with a slew of live-action footage – including Wake on a talk show.

The footage is then followed by gameplay showing combat with dual protagonists Saga Anderson and, of course, Alan Wake. It's all very spooky.

The footage was brief, but to see it yourself, check out the trailer below:

Alan Wake 2 was originally set to be released on October 17 but was pushed back to October 27. For more info, check out our recent preview.

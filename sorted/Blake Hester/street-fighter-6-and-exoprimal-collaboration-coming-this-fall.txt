  Street Fighter 6 and Exoprimal Collaboration Coming This Fall






            The recently-released Street Fighter 6 and the soon-to-be-released Exoprimal are getting a crossover event in the fall, as announced today during Summer Games Fest. 

Details are a bit scarce right now, but in the trailer, we see mecha-inspired Ryu talking with Exoprimal's artificial intelligence, Leviathan, who welcomes the fighter to Bikitoa Island. We also catch a glimpse of Ryu fighting dinosaurs. Ostensibly, all of this takes place within Exorpimal. It's to be determined if any of the crossover content will come to Street Fighter 6. The trailer concludes with a glimpse of Guile also showing up to Bikitoa, but concludes without any further info.

Check it out below:

While Exoprimal is out on July 14, the Street Fighter collab isn't expected until this fall. Interestingly, it's being billed as "Capcom Collab 1," implying future collaborations in the future, though no details were given.

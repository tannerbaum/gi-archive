  Tchia Release Date Set For March






            Tchia, the new adventure game from Awaceb that's more than a little reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, finally has a release date. As announced today during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Tchia will be released on March 21. 

It was also announced that the game will be available on PlayStation Plus via its Premium and Extra catalogs.

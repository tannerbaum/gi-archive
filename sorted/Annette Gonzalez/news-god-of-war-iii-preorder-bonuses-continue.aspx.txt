  OMGOW! God Of War III Pre-Order Bonuses Continue






For all of you blood-thirsty God of War fans itching to get your hands on God of War III, you can now get a bonus, bonus item just for pre-ordering. In addition to the previously announced Phantom of Chaos character skin, if you pre-order at GameStop, you can pick up an exclusive GOW III poster signed by concept artist Andy Park (pictured below). You'll get to take your poster home with you as soon as you place your order, and gaze at it as you count down the days to March 16. Anyone else bursting with excitement over this game?
Full disclosure: GameStop is the parent company of Game Informer.

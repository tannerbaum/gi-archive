  Bulletstorm Director Not Excited About AAA Games






According to GamesIndustry, Adrian Chmielarz, the former creative director and co-owner of People Can Fly, is no longer interested in AAA titles. Instead, he is going to focus on smaller projects with new studio The Astronauts. 
"It's the same idea: get the best in [the] business under one umbrella, have a studio with a very flat structure, be 100 percent responsible for the glory and the shame, and work on games that get our hearts beat[ing] faster," says Chmielarz.
"One thing [is] different, though: we're no longer excited by mammoth-sized games," he adds. "We're still very interested in high quality, but now and in the future we want to focus on smaller projects."
People Can Fly created wacky shooter Bulletstorm, and also worked on Epic Games' Gears of War franchise.
Chmielarz left the company with Andrzej Poznanski and Michal Kosieradzki to form The Astronauts after Epic bought People Can Fly this past August.
"We had a blast working on the foundation for Gears of War: Judgment, but after our part was done we just thought it's time for us to go for, to quote Monty Python, 'something completely different,'" says Chmielarz. “Quite literally, as the game we're making is not a shooter."
To change things up, The Astronauts is working on The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for PC, a horror game with no combat set to release this year. You can read more about it here, and also watch the game's trailer. To find out where Chmielarz got his start, check out the video below.

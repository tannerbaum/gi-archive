  The Last Of Us Part II Delayed Until May






            Neil Druckmann has confirmed that The Last of Us Part II will not meet its original February 21 release. In a post on the PlayStation blog, Druckmann announced the game’s new release date: May 29. 

Despite the “blowout” announcement during last month’s State of Play, The Last of Us Part II may not be as finished as Naughty Dog originally hoped. In his post, Druckmann states, “We realized we simply didn’t have enough time to bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality.”

This may disappointment many fans but there’s consolation in knowing the final game won’t cut any corners.

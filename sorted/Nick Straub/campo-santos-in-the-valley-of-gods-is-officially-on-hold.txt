  Campo Santo's In The Valley Of Gods Is Officially On Hold






            In a statement to Polygon, Jake Rodkin, co-founder of Campo Santo, said that “In the Valley of Gods development is on hold.” While the game is not canceled its future is uncertain as the Campo Santo staff are now working on a variety of projects for Valve, including Dota Underlords and the recently announced Half-Life: Alyx.

In the Valley of Gods future seems even shakier with Rodkin giving an ambiguous statement on whether the team will ever return to the project: “In the Valley of Gods' development is on hold — but it certainly feels like a project people can and may return to.”

This is certainly a blow to fans who have been eagerly awaiting this title since its announcement at the Game Awards two years ago.

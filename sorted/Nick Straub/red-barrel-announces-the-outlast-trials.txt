  Red Barrel Announces The Outlast Trials 






            Set during the Cold War, The Outlast Trials breaks new ground for the series as it introduces cooperative play. The game is in active development at Red Barrel, and, aside from its existence, details are mostly scarce. What we know, according to Polygon, is that the game is not a sequel and its’ co-op is for up to four players. We also know, from Red Barrel’s official statement, that the story involves an experiment. Whether or not the game revolves around experiencing said experiment, escaping from it, or both, has yet to be revealed.

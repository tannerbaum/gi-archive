Cyan Inc., the studio behind Myst and Obduction, have revealed a teaser trailer for their upcoming game Firmament. The trailer is narrated by an ethereal voice as the camera guides the view through snow-capped mountains and abandoned steam-punk machinery. A mysterious orb breathes new life and an apparition appears to accompany you on your journey of discovery. The orb acts as a power source for the machinery around you as the narrator speaks of the hope you bring and an arrival to come.

Firmament's website offers scant details about the game, stating that it is a "resplendent, magical journey — a monumental voyage through four diverse and curious realms." No platforms have officially been announced, but the studio's YouTube channel says it's a new VR experience. To see what we thought of the studio's last game, Obduction, check out our review.

  Dauntless Open Beta Releases Next Month






Phoenix Labs, an indie game studio made of former members of Bioware, Riot, and Capcom, has announced that their upcoming co-op action RPG Dauntless will be launching an open beta on May 24. The closed beta has been running since September 2017 and over 100,000 players have slayed Behemoths across the Shattered Isles. Currently, over 700,000 additional players have signed up for the open beta and Phoenix Labs is thrilled to share Dauntless with a larger audience.
“Dauntless is more than four years in the making, and we can’t wait for everyone to join us in the Shattered Isles, team up with friends, take on Behemoths, craft epic gear and bring the world to life,” said CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs Jesse Houston. “As we close in on our next phase of this adventure, we thank our passionate community that has been with us from day-one, providing feedback and helping craft the experience into what it is today. It has been an honor to create Dauntless together with you!” 
The open beta will be free for all PC players starting on May 24, but those who are interested in hopping on for the closed beta can purchase the Founder's Pack and start playing. In the meantime, you can check out why Dauntless made our list as one of the most anticipated PC games of 2018.

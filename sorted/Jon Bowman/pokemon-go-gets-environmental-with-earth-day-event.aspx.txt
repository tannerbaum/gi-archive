  Pokémon Go Gets Environmental With Earth Day Event






Pokémon Go is a game about getting up and out into the world, and with its upcoming Earth Day event, it's encouraging players to make that world a better place. Pokémon Go-getters can make a difference this Earth Day by participating in the Pokémon Go Earth Day Cleanup event on April 22.
Niantic has partnered up with Mission Blue, Playmob, and local non-profits to encourage Pokémon Go players to go to select locations and lending a helping hand by picking up trash and cleaning up the environment. Players will earn boosts to Stardust when catching Ground, Water, and Grass-type Pokémon, depending on how many registered players are in that given area.
For more information on the event and how to register, head over to the event page.

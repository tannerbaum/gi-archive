Guacamelee 2, the sequel to 2013's heavyweight champion of indie darlings, is coming to PC via Steam (previously, the game had only been announced for PS4). To celebrate in style, Drinkbox Studios announced that they're taking 90% off of their games on Steam. If you have a couple bucks to spare and are into Metroidvania games, the original Guacamelee is well worth your time.

We're pretty excited to dust off our luchador masks and team up with up to four others for co-op in Guacamelee 2 and after some hands-on time with the demo, we're glad that Drinkbox isn't trying to fix what isn't broken. Guacamelee 2 is scheduled sometime in 2018 on PlayStation 4 and PC.

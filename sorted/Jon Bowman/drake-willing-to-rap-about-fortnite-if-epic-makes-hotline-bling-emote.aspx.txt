  Drake Willing To Rap About Fortnite If Epic Makes Hotline Bling Emote






If there's one thing that's been missing from the recent celebrity pop of Fortnite, it's a Hotline Bling emote. Drake just appeared on another stream with Twitch superstar Tyler "Ninja" Blevins, and while this one didn't smash any viewing records, Drake mentioned he would be willing to write a rap about Fortnite if Epic Games would include his iconic dance as an emote.
During the stream, Ninja stoked the flames in favor of the rap, saying that Drake should include some Fortnite lingo on his next album. “It has to happen, it’s just gotta be the right way,” Drake responded. “Someone’s gonna do it. Someone’s gonna pull it off. I say when Epic gives me the emote, when Epic gives me the Hotline Bling emote, I’ll do it. Until then, I’m on strike.”

Our TakeI'm surprised that Hotline Bling wasn't made into an emote immediately after the first time that Ninja and Drake teamed up to stream Fortnite. Maybe this is something that Epic wants to save for the Party Royale during E3. Granted, I have little knowledge on the licensing issues that would go into including that emote in the game, but if the demand is high enough, it's only a matter of time until Epic adds it in.

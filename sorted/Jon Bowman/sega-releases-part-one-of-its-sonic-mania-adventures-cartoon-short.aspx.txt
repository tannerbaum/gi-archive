In the first installment, we see the titular hero tracking down his arch nemesis, Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik, before falling into the doctor's trap. Sonic is able to outsmart the nefarious Eggman by playing at his sense of greed. Once freed from his predicament, Sonic finds a device Eggman had been using to track down a series of Chaos Emeralds and discovers that some unknown character is in possession of two of them. Will we find out who holds those two Chaos Emeralds, and will that character be friend or foe? Will Eggman be able to obtain all of them? We'll have to keep an eye out for part two of Sonic Mania Adventures to find out!

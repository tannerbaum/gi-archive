  Boss Key Productions Stepping Back From Lawbreakers






LawBreakers, a gravity-defying arena shooter on PC and PS4, had a troubling launch and even early map and mode additions have not helped it find its footing. In a studio update posted today, Boss Key Productions acknowledged that LawBreakers has not lived up to their expectations and stated that it has "failed to find enough of an audience to generate the funds necessary to keep it sustained."
The studio does intend to continue support for the game as they explore how to transition to a free-to-play model, but they intend to move onto other projects and don't have any future updates planned for LawBreakers at this time. There is no word yet on what future projects Boss Key has planned.

Our TakeOne of the hardest decisions any studio will ever have to make is the decision to let go of a project that they've been working on for years. We wish the team the best in their future projects. Maybe taking a step back while exploring the free-to-play option and working on other games will allow the studio to circle back to LawBreakers with a renewed energy somewhere down the line.

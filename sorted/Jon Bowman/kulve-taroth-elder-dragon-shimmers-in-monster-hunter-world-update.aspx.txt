  Kulve Taroth Elder Dragon Shimmers In Monster Hunter World Update






Monster Hunter World's Spring Blossom Event may be coming to a close, but hot on its heels is a new, terrifying foe. On April 19th, the Siege of Kulve Taroth begins. This new limited-time quest tasks hunters to team up and track down the golden Kulve Taroth Elder Dragon for all the glory and loot.
For this Elder Dragon hunt, Capcom is introducing a Siege quest, which allows more collaboration than ever. Up to 16 hunters can team up in the same Gathering Hub to hunt down the same Kulve Taroth. Hunters will then be split into groups of four to track down this golden monster. As each group of four tracks and damages the Kulve Taroth, they make progress to the Siege for all of the involved hunters.

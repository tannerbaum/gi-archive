  Westworld Season 2 Trailer Offers Glimpse Into Shogun World






"Why on Earth would you ever be frightened of me?" Delores says with a disarming smile.
With a piano rendition of Nirvana's "Heart-Shaped Box" setting the stage, the second season of Westworld is poised to see the beginning of the war between humanity and hosts. Perhaps more interestingly, we also get a brief glimpse into Shogun World as a samurai warrior marches past some troops, Maeve (Thandie Newton) walks around in a kimono, and a geisha pops up during the trailer's climax.

Westworld's second season premieres April 22 on HBO.

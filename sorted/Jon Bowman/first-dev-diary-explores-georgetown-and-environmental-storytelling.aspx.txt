In a series like The Walking Dead, sometimes the most impactful stories aren't told through the lens of the characters themselves, but through the ravaged world that has been left behind. The first developer diary for Overkill's The Walking Dead, the Payday team's upcoming co-op shooter, dives into the creation of Georgetown, a key neighborhood in the game's take on Washington D.C. The dev diary explores both the exterior of the unkempt neighborhood as well as several interior shots, creating a visual story of the lives that have been abandoned in the wake of the walkers.

"One of the most important parts of being an environment artist is to always ask the question 'Why?', because then you can give everything a meaning." said Jacob Claussen, an environment artist on the project. "And if you give everything a meaning, you can get a sense of a lived-in world."

The last time we saw this game was back in December when the studio released a trailer for one of the playable characters, Aiden. Overkill's The Walking Dead is coming to PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in Fall 2018.

  Hearthstone Expansion The Witchwood Releases Next Week






A month after it was first announced, The Witchwood expansion for Hearthstone is set to release on April 12.Â 
The expansion features a new single-player experience called Monster Hunt, where players can choose one of four new heros and explore the dangers of The Witchwood. After each encounter, players will get to choose between three random sets of cards to add them to their deck.
Those who pre-order The Witchwood will receive a special 70 card bundle, while those who don't plan on getting the expansion can still log in to receive three card packs and a random Cass legendary card for free.
You can also check out the final card reveal with game director Ben Brode and Sean "Day[9]" Plott on April 9 at 11:00 a.m. PDT through Hearthstone's Twitch channel.

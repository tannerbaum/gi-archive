  Don’t Nod Reveals A Mysterious Adventure Game Lost Records: Bloom & Rage






            Don’t Nod, the team behind Jusant and Life is Strange, has a new story-driven adventure game called Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.

The trailer begins rather innocently in 1995 with a group of four young high school friends –  Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat – partying together without a care in the world. The video then takes a darker turn with hints that something sinister, and perhaps otherworldly, flipping their lives on their heads. 27 years pass with no contact between the friends, but the secret they swore not to talk about again brings them back together. Lost Records: Bloom & Rage is the first title of Don't Nod's Montreal studio. 

The game is coming in late 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

  Ikaro Will Not Die Is A Fast-Paced Action Roguelite From The Makers Of Powerwash Simulator 






            Ikaro Will Not Die is a new game from Powerwash Simulator and Velocity developer Futurlab that made its debut during today’s Xbox Partner Preview. Players presumably control Ikaro, who, as far as we can tell, has one purpose in life: to move really fast and look really cool.

The game is billed as a momentum-based action roguelite, with players zipping around neon-soaked cyberpunk world dishing out rapid melee attacks while executing air dashing and somersaults to evade and outmaneuver enemies. Check out its first trailer below. 

Ikaro Will Not Die doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.

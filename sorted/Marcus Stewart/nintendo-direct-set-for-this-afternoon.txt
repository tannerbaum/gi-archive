The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 

Given that this is Nintendo, it's always possible they'll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow's Direct? Let us know in the comments.

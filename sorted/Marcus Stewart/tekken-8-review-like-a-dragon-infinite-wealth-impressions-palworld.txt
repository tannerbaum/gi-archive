            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew unpacks our Tekken 8 review to discuss what's great and what's less great about the latest King of Iron Fist tournament. We also share our early game impressions of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. And lastly, we'll take a deep dive into Palworld's meteoric rise and success, as well as the discourse and controversy surrounding it. Of course, it wouldn't be an episode without answering a few questions from our listeners!

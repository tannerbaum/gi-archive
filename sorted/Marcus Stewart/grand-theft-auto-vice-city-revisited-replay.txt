  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Revisited | Replay






            With Grand Theft Auto VI set to take players back to Vice City (albeit in contemporary times), we decided it was a good time to take another look back at the series' first spin on South Florida. Join Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart as they dive right into the middle of Tommy Vercetti's rise to power and stay tuned for the reveal of our next Super Replay.

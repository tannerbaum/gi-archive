  Three New Xbox Series X/S Models Are Coming This Holiday






            The Xbox Games Showcase revealed three new models of Series X/S consoles coming this holiday. They include two all-digital models and a beefier Series X.

If you're all about digital gaming, the new All-Digital Series X and Series S boxes are for you. Both come in "robot white" and sport a 1TB SSD. The Series S is basically a white version of the black 1TB Series S revealed last year.Â The third console is a special edition "galaxy black" Series X that features a 2 TB SSD (and includes a disc drive) along with a green-accented controller.

Here are the prices:

All-Digital Xbox Series S (1TB) - $349.99

All-Digital Xbox Series X (1TB) - $449.99

Special Edition Xbox Series X (2TB) - $599.99

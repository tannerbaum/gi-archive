  Here’s The First Trailer For Amazon’s Like A Dragon Series






            Last month, we learned Sega and Amazon had partnered to create a live-action series based on the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series. Over the weekend, during the San Diego Comic-Con, the studio unveiled the first teaser trailer. 

Like A Dragon: Yakuza centers on Kazuma Kiryu (played by Takeuchi Ryoma) and follows his life during two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Set in the series’ fictional Tokyo district of Kamurochō, the trailer’s synopsis states the show “depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people” and will explore stories the games haven’t been able to.

  Steam Deck OLED Announced






            Valve has unveiled its first upgraded iteration of the Steam Deck. Dubbed simply the Steam Deck OLED, the new handheld features several technical and form factor improvements, and it goes on sale next week.

As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.

The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

Steam Deck OLED becomes available for purchase on November 16 at 1 p.m. ET. It comes in three models based on storage and add-ons, including one Limited Edition variant featuring a different color scheme. Here’s a breakdown of the specs and price of each one:

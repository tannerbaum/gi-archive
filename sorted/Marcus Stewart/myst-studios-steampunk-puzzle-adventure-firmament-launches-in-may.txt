  Myst Studio’s Steampunk Puzzle Adventure Firmament Launches In May






            Firmament, the upcoming puzzle adventure game by the studio behind Myst, Riven, and Obduction, finally has a release date, and it’s just a month away.

The game launches on PC and Mac on May 18 and will come to PlayStation consoles and PS VR2 at a later date. Firmament was initially funded via Kickstarter and was first teased way back in March 2018. It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2.

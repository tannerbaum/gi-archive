  Dragon's Dogma 2 Still Looks Wild In New Gameplay Trailer






            Capcom gave fans another look at Dragon’s Dogma 2 during today’s State of Play presentation. Today’s trailer focused purely on gameplay, showing off some of the monster-climbing action.

The trailer doesn't offer a ton in the ways of storytelling set up, instead serving as a flashy highlight reel of what's likely the game's strongest suit: action. Whether you're slaying beasts with swords and axes or blasting them with magic, Dragon's Dogma 2 looks as thrilling as fans would expect. 

Dragon’s Dogman 2 launches on March 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

We'll also learn more details of The First Berserker: Khazan, the single-player action RPG set in the Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) universe. Microsoft says this will be a “no frills” showcase, meaning it will consist of nothing but new trailers, new games, behind-the-scenes looks, and release date announcements.

  Marvel's Blade Is Coming From The Makers Of Deathloop And Dishonored






            Arkane has announced that it's jumping into the Marvel universe by announcing a video game based on Blade.

The title, aptly named Marvel's Blade, is coming from Arkane Lyon, the team behind Deathloop and the Dishonored series, in collaboration with Marvel Games. Announced on Blade's 50th anniversary, the game is described as a single-player, mature-rated third-person action-adventure game set in Paris. The city has been plagued with vampires, so it's up to you to put a stop to it. Though it will feature plenty of action, it's described as a "very Arkane game", so fans should potentially expect it to have several of the studio's signature immersive sim hallmarks. 

Marvel's Blade has no release date or platform.

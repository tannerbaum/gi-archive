  Goosebumps: Dead Of Night | Replay






            Readers beware! You’re in for a scare! At least, that’s what we hope as we’re taking a week off from our Super Replay of Demon’s Souls to get into the Halloween spirit by playing Goosebumps: Dead of Night! Join us on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we revisit our childhoods with the most recent console game based on the live-action films based on the popular children’s horror books. Got all that? 

Goosebumps: Dead of Night is an adventure game that pits players against Slappy the Dummy, who has unleashed all manner of frights upon them. Classic monsters such as the Werewolf of Fever Swamp and the Graveyard Ghoul are just some of the familiar – and frightening faces – we’ll encounter. The game even has a Jack Black-voiced R.L. Stine! Will it be cheesy? Most likely. Should it make for an entertaining romp? You bet your soon-to-be-haunted butts. 

Join Goosebumps fan Marcus Stewart and horror experts Dan Tack and Blake Hester as they dive into this quirky adventure. We’ll have two hours to make it as far into the game’s three chapters as possible. Who knows, we might even beat the game! You’ll have to join us on Twitch to find out or check out our YouTube channel to watch the archived stream over the weekend.

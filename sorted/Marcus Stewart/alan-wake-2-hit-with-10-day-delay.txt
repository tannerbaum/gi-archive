  Alan Wake 2 Hit With 10-Day Delay






            Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.

In a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn't cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”

This likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. 

Alan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around.

Alan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.

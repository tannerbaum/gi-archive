  The Stone Breaks On Gargoyles Remastered Next Month






            One of the most succinct yet exciting announcements from last year’s D23 Expo was Gargoyles Remastered, a modernized facelift of the classic (and challenging) side-scrolling Sega Genesis title based on the popular ‘90s cartoon. A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.

Gargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below.

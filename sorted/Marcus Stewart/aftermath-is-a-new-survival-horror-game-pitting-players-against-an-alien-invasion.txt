  Aftermath Is A New Survival Horror Game Pitting Players Against An Alien Invasion






            Developer One-O-One Games and Meta Publishing have pulled the curtain back on Aftermath, a new survival horror game coming next year. Players control an astronaut who returns to Earth after a mission only to find the planet upended by an alien invasion.

After a botched reentry to Earth, protagonist Charlie Gray finds herself alone, emotionally broken, but driven by a singular mission to locate her missing daughter. She’s up against an intimidating extraterrestrial menace, specifically an invisible hunter tracking her every move. Charlie must outwit this foe to survive while also confronting more in-your-face threats such as shambling corpse-like creatures in over-the-shoulder third-person combat. Charlie may not be a soldier, but she is a brilliant engineer, using those skills to concoct blueprints for tools by examining everyday objects. Think of her like a McGyver. As a survival game, managing Charlie’s nutrition, hydration, and mental health are vital.

Aftermath’s foreboding presentation and atmosphere come courtesy of artist Alessandro Bavari, art designer for Alien: Covenant. The soundtrack boasts original tracks from artists such as Unkle, Planet Funk, and others. 

If Aftermath piques your interest, keep an eye out when it launches in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

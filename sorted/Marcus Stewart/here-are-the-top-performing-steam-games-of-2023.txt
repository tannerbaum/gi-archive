  Here Are The Top Performing Steam Games Of 2023






            Valve has released its annual "Best Of" list highlighting the top-performing games on Steam measured by gross revenue and player engagement.

The categories are top sellers, best-selling new releases, most-played games on PC, most-played games on Steam Deck, highest-grossing early access games, most-played using a controller, and best-selling VR titles. The top 12 games in each category earn Platinum status, while everything below them is grouped into a descending ranking of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. It's a fun snapshot of the games Steam users dug into most this year and a reminder that games seemingly on the downtrend or long in the tooth (like, say, Destiny 2) clearly have a lot of players still logging in to play.  

You can view the complete list here, but we’ve listed the Platinum-ranked games alphabetically in each category (Valve does not rank these games).

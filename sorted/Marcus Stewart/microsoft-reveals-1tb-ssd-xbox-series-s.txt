  Microsoft Reveals 1TB SSD Xbox Series S






            For those in the market for an Xbox Series S with more storage, Microsoft has unveiled a 1-terabyte SSD model of the console that launches on September 1.

This carbon black version of the slimmer Xbox boasts roughly double the storage of its original white counterpart. That also means it’s more expensive, retailing for a hundred bucks more at $349.

As a reminder, the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive. It's also weaker than the $500 Series X, but even this new version remains a decent budget option for those looking to enter the current generation of gaming. 

What do you think of this new version of the Series S? Let us know in the comments.

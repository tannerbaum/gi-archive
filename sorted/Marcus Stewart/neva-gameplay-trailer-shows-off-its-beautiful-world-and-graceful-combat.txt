  Neva Gameplay Trailer Shows Off Its Beautiful World And Graceful Combat






            Neva, the next game by Gris developer Nomada Studios, got its first big gameplay showing during Summer Game Fest. In it, a woman and her wolf companion explore a beautiful world while fending off dangerous creatures in a cursed world.

Gris was notable for its beautiful art direction, and Neva is no slouch in that department. It looks beautiful, as do the animations of the woman, Alba, and Neva, her canine companion. In addition to platforming, Alba can gracefully cut down foes with her sword as Neva backs her in combat. It's also worth noting that Neva appears to age over time, growing much larger than Alba indicating the game unfolds over a substantial passage of time.

Neva is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC later this year.

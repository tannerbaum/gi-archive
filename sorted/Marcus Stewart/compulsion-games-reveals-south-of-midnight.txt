  Compulsion Games Reveals South Of Midnight 






            Compulsion Games, makers of We Happy Few and Contrast, has announced a fascinating new project called South of Midnight.

The stylish trailer begins with a strange (and giant) musician strumming his guitar surrounded by forest critters in a bayou-like swamp. A young woman pays a visit to inquire about a dangerous monster, which attempts to ambush her until she retaliates by weaving a seemingly magical web to subdue it. There's no gameplay, and the trailer's description describes South of Midnight as a "fantastical and macabre third-person action-adventure set in the American Deep South."

  Palworld Catches A January Early Access Launch Date






            Palworld has always seemed too good to be true, given its vibrant world and amazingly absurd premise of inserting guns and survival features into a Pokémon-inspired open-world game. After a long wait, fans will finally get to try it for themselves early next year.

Developer Pocketpair revealed during Summer Game Fest that Palworld is launching in Steam Early Access in January. A long wait to be sure (especially since the game was last slated to enter Early Access this year), but we'll take any proof that this game is a real thing because it continues to look bonkers.

Palworld takes place in a world where players can catch and befriend cute, legally-distinct monsters called Pals. The game features an open world that supports multiplayer (up to 8 players) where you can have Pals give a helping hand in battles or in exploration, put them to work making resources in your factories, sell them off, or just eat them. Combat unfolds as a third-person shooter with players wielding assault weapons and other guns to blast enemy Pals and other threats, or you can use Pal’s unique abilities to get the job done. In multiplayer, you can explore together, trade Pals, or steal each other's monsters and items in battle.

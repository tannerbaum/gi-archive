  Streets Of Rogue 2 Hits Early Access In 2024






            Streets of Rogue 2 is on the way, and we got our first look at its over-the-top action during the pre-show of Gamescom Opening Night Live.

The sequel to the 2019 roguelite action game now unfolds in a procedurally generated open-world sandbox 100 times larger than any level from its predecessor. It sports a variety of locations where everything is fully destructible. Playable characters can take on dozens of classes, such as cops, farmers, hackers, and even a gorilla, in a quest to overthrow a corrupt mayor and take control of the zany world.

How you go about doing that is up to you, as the game promotes creative, open-ended gameplay with a multitude of possible methods and solutions to your quest. Whether that involves using a variety of bizarre weapons, getting behind the wheel of different vehicles, or simply building a dream home to farm and relax, the answer to "What can you do in this game?" appears to be "Yes."

The game supports co-op (both local and online), features a ton of side quests, and characters controlled by what a press release describes as “advanced A.I.” Streets of Rogue 2 looks even more nuts than the first game based on the reveal trailer, and we look forward to seeing how it shapes up with it launches on Steam Early Access next year.

  Ikumi Nakamura Reveals Her Studio's First Title, Kemuri






            Former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura stepped on the stage of The Game Awards to reveal the first game from her studio, Unseen, called Kemuri.

A stylish trailer showed off the slick art direction with various cool street folks doing some parkour-style running and jumping while brandishing weapons such as a katana. They also seem to be facing a slew of supernatural beings. Unfortunately, the cinematic doesn’t reveal much in terms of gameplay or details, but it's a cool first showing, if nothing else. Check it out for yourself below.

  Super Replay | Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts






            Super Replay returns, and we're checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts!  Released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008, the third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will we land on it? Let's find out. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

  Ultros, A Psychedelic Cosmic Metroidvania | New Gameplay Today






            Ultros is a bizarre and mesmerising Metroidvania-style action game arriving on February 13. Our layman's description wouldn't do the game justice, so here's the official synopsis on its Steam page:

You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play.

What does all of that even mean? Join Marcus Stewart and Charles Harte as they explore an early slice of Ultros to figure out what the heck is going on while indulging its promising gameplay.

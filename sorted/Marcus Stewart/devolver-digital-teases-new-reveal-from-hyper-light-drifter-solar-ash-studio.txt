  Devolver Digital Teases New Reveal From Hyper Light Drifter, Solar Ash Studio






            Devolver Digital has released an intriguing teaser for what appears to be a new project by Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine. The reveal is advertised for June 7, the day of the Devolver Direct showcase.

Heart Machine is currently working on Hyper Light Breaker, a 3D third-person co-op action game that is the spiritual successor to Hyper Light Drifter. Gearbox is publishing that game, confirming Devolver's teaser is for something different. Based on this brief clip, it’s hard to gauge the nature of this game. It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine's logo. But given the studio’s impressive pedigree, we’re excited and surprised to see a new title so soon.

The Devolver Direct airs on June 7 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. You can keep up with the other summer showcases with our evolving schedule of events. For more on Heart Machine, check out our extended preview for Hyper Light Breaker and our reviews of Solar Ash and Hyper Light Drifter.

  PlayStation Plus Monthly Games For November Serve Up Mafia, Dragon Ball, And Aliens






            The PlayStation Plus motley games for November have been revealed. Subscribers can add Mafia II: Definitive Edition, Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and Aliens Fireteam Elite to their libraries beginning on November 7 until December 4. 

Mafia II: Definitive Edition

This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

Dragon Ball: The Breakers

This 7-v-1 multiplayer game pits a team of random normies, plus Bulma and Oolong, against a player controlling iconic Dragon Ball villains like Frieza, Cell, and Buu. The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 

Aliens: Fireteam Elite

Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing, 

Aliens: Fireteam Elite occasionally fires on all cylinders, especially during battles. Xenomorph and synthetic limbs tear at you as you buffet them with high-energy bullets. The carnage produces pools of acid blood that deal extra damage if you don’t watch your step. Even Austin Wintory’s dissonant score and the array of nostalgic sound effects – particularly the whirring pulse rifle and thudding footsteps of approaching drones – help immerse you in the Alien universe. Unfortunately, there’s not enough interesting or entertaining content to parse through, and the grind gets tedious. Developer Cold Iron Studios promised a year of post-launch content, but unless substantial changes are made to the loop, you’re better off steering clear of this messy infestation.

As a reminder, you have until November 6 to add October's monthly games to your library. As another heads up for new subscribers or those getting ready to renew, the prices for each PlayStation Plus tier has increased starting in September. You can read a breakdown of the price changes here.

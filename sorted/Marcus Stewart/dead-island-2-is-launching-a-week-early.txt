  Dead Island 2 Is Launching A Week Early






            Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.

The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. 

You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.

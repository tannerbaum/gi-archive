  Ballad Of Antara Is A Gorgeous Free-To-Play Fantasy Action Game Where You Carry A Kid On Your Back






            Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.

Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: "You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way."

In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 

Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.

  Resident Evil 7: Biohazard And Resident Evil 2 Remake Are Coming To iPhone 15 Pro And Other Apple Platforms






            Resident Evil continues to gradually infect Apple platforms with the reveal that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the remake of Resident Evil 2 are coming to iOS. The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."

Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.

RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 

Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.

  Final Fantasy XVI Is Getting Two DLCs And One Of Them Is Available Now






            Despite claiming that it had no plans to release DLC for Final Fantasy XVI, Square Enix announced at The Game Awards that Final Fantasy XVI is getting not one but two pieces of DLC. They're called Echoes of the Fallen and Rising Tide, and the former is available to play right now.

Echoes of the Fallen adds new story chapters that takes place before the finale of Final Fantasy XVI. Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King. Oh, and Leviathan pops up too. 

You can purchase each DLC separately or together for a discount in an expansion pass. You can read our review of Final Fantasy XVI here.

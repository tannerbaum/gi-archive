  Here Are The Winners Of The 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards






            The 27th annual D.I.C.E. Awards took place yesterday. While it doesn’t have the mainstream flashiness of the Game Awards, D.I.C.E. is a more industry-focused (and arguably more prestigious) event that honors the best games and creators of the last year. It is hosted and judged by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) along with votes from over 30,000 industry experts, developers, and studios. 

You can view the full list of nominees here. The big winners were Baldur’s Gate 3, which won Game of the Year among other accolades, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which walked away with six awards. Additionally, legendary Nintendo composer Koji Kondo was inducted into the AIAS Hall of Fame during the ceremony.

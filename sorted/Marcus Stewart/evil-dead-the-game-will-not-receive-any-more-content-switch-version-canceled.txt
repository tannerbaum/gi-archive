  Evil Dead: The Game Will Not Receive Any More Content, Switch Version Canceled






            Development of new content for Evil Dead: The Game has ceased, developer Saber Interactive has announced. The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.

In a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. 

To the Evil Dead: The Game community,

Today, we have made the decision not to pursue the development of new content for Evil Dead: The Game. We also confirm that we will not be releasing a Nintendo Switch version of the game.

We will keep the servers up for the foreseeable future and address any major issues that arise.

On behalf of the entire team at Saber, thank you for all the groovy times and your continued support.

Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, "It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced." You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

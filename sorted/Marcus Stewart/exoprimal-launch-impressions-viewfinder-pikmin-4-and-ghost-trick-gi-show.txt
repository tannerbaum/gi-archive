  Exoprimal Launch Impressions, Viewfinder, Pikmin 4, And Ghost Trick | GI Show 






            Dinosaurs are pouring into this week's episode of The Game Informer Show as editor Marcus Stewart unpacks his evolving thoughts on Capcom's new dino-flavored shooter, Exoprimal. Kyle Hilliard discusses his Pikmin 4 and Viewfinder reviews while also dishing out his early impressions of Gunbrella. Charles Harte chats about playing the re-release of Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective for the first time, but not before Kyle serenades listeners with his soulful rendition of a lunch-themed Sonic the Hedgehog cover song.

  Resident Evil 4’s Rain Will Be 'Adjusted' In Day One Patch






            As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 

In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 

“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”

So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  

Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

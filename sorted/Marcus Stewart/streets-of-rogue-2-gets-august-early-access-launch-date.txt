  Streets Of Rogue 2 Gets August Early Access Launch Date






            Streets of Rogue 2 is coming to Steam Early Access on August 14. The news comes via the PC Gaming Show, which also premiered a new trailer for the open-world sandbox game.

Set in a living, procedurally generated world, Streets of Rogue 2 gives players one task: take down a corrupt president. How they accomplish that is up to them. Whether that means helping citizens with their problems or causing absolute chaos, the game gives players the freedom to twist and bend its colorful, destructible world to their whims. Sporting a variety of playable characters with unique talents, such as a ninja, chef, or hacker, you can cruise around in cars, boats, and other vehicles. 

There's no word on how long Streets of Rogue 2 will be in Early Access, but creator Matt Dabrowski says to expect "multiple exciting updates" as it gears up for a 1.0 launch.

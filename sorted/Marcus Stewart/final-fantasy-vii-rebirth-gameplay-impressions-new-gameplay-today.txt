  Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Gameplay Impressions | New Gameplay Today






            We took a trip to Los Angeles last week to play two sections of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. You can get an in-depth breakdown of our impressions by reading this preview, but you can also watch what we played in this episode of New Gameplay Today! Join Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they take a look at the Mt. Nibel mission and the open world on the outskirts of Junon that shows off plenty of combat, side missions, and spectacular boss fights.

  Rogue Legacy 2 | Game Informer Live






            Now that Rogue Legacy 2 has gone 1.0, I’ll be touring its finished state today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central. 

Rogue Legacy 2 has been in early access for a couple of years, building upon its predecessor’s fun – and challenging – roguelite formula. You still control members of a warrior bloodline who must battle through a procedurally generated castle rife with dangers. Every death gives you a new character you can outfit with helpful/strange genetic traits, from dealing increased attack damage to farting every time you perform an action. 

Look forward to watching a fun stream as I’ll likely be sending an entire generation of warriors to their doom. Our review will arrive in the coming days, so be sure to read our review in progress for editor John Carson’s current thoughts on the game. 

If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be given entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!

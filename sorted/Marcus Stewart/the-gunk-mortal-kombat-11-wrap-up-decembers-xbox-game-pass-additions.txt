  The Gunk, Mortal Kombat 11 Wrap Up December’s Xbox Game Pass Additions






            As 2021 begins to wind down, Microsoft has unveiled the second batch of titles joining Xbox Game Pass this month. In terms of new releases, The Gunk by SteamWorld developers Image & Form launches this week. It’s joined by the ultra-violent and highly celebrated Mortal Kombat 11 (the base version), a pair of exceptional adventure games in Firewatch and Broken Age, and Lake, a relaxing small-town story about delivering mail.

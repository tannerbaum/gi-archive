  Thirsty Suitors Joins Netflix Games Roster, The Case Of The Golden Idol And More Available Now






            Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.

Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There's no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it's "coming soon."

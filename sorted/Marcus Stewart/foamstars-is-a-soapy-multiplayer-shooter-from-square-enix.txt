  Foamstars Is A Soapy Multiplayer Shooter From Square Enix






            Today’s PlayStation Showcase saw Square Enix unveil a squeaky-clean online shooter called Foamstars. 

This wacky new multiplayer shooter pits two teams of four against each other using weapons that shoot, you guessed it, foam. Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points. The trailer shows off a bunch of goofy weapons and the game pretty much feels like the anti-thesis of Splatoon. 

Square Enix promises to share more about Foamstars in the future, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and 4.

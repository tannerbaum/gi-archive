  Rogue Legacy 2 Starts A New Run On PlayStation Next Week






            Rogue Legacy 2 is one heck of a roguelike that only Xbox, Switch, and PC fans have enjoyed since it launched in 1.0 last year. Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.

Developer Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. 

We awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, "Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."

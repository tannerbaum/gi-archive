  Into the Pit Is A Spellcasting, Retro-Inspired FPS Roguelite Heading To Xbox Game Pass






            Into the Pit is a new retro-inspired first-person roguelite that premiered during today's Xbox Gamescom presentation. Instead of shooting guns, you control a mystic warrior dual-wielding magic to blast apart supernatural foes in search of a demonic portal and a missing relative. 

You and your cousin are part of a family of mystics constantly searching for magical lore. Your cousin travels to a land cursed with occult energy and seemingly vanishes upon discovering a village plagued by a demonic pit. It's up to you to find out what terrors this village has unleashed and the fate of your cousin. 

The premiere trailer showed off the old-school 3D visuals, which appear inspired by early first-person shooters but shined up considerably. In that footage, we see spells can be mixed and matched in various ways to battle through ever-shifting dungeons. Along the way, you'll rescue villagers to unlock shops used to purchase permanent upgrades.

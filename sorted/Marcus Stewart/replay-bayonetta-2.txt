  Replay | Bayonetta 2






            To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we're bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 

Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn't happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn't meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

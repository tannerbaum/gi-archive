  Jurassic Park: Survival Is A Stunning First-Person Adventure Set Right After The First Film






            Jurassic Park fans got a nice surprise during The Game Awards with the reveal of a new game called Jurassic Park: Survival. The cinematic trailer shows a young woman named Dr. Maya Joshi, an InGen scientist left behind on Isla Nublar in the immediate aftermath of the first film – one day after the park collapses, in fact.

Players explore the open world of Isla Nublar, which teems with a variety of newly escaped dinosaurs in a fully reactive world. Stealth seems to be more emphasized than combat, as players must use their intelligence, skills, and wit to outsmart and avoid John Hammond's prehistoric creations.

Jurassic Park: Survival has no release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

  Solar Ash, Lies Of P, And Starfield Come To Xbox Game Pass This Month






            Xbox Game Pass has a small batch of new games hitting the first half of September, but what they lack in quantity, they make up for in quality and hype.

First off, Solar Ash, Heart Machine’s exceptional high-speed platforming action game, finally arrives on Xbox. Lies of P, the Pinocchio-inspired Souls-like action title, hits this month too. Oh, and a little game called Starfield blasts off for everyone this week. Check out the full list of new arrivals (alongside links to our respective reviews) along with the games exiting the library.

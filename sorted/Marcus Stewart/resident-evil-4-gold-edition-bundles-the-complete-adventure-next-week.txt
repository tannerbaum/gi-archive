  Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition Bundles The Complete Adventure Next Week






            Last year’s remake of Resident Evil 4 was a fantastic game, and the addition of a revamped Separate Ways DLC made it even better. But if you’ve been holding out on jumping into Leon’s mission to save Ashley, now may be a good time to take on Las Plagas with the announcement of Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition.

Launching on February 9, this version includes the base game, Separate Ways, and the Extra DLC pack (previously only available in the Deluxe Edition) of character skins, weapons, and items. Of course, The Mercenaries mode serves as free DLC. The price is unknown at the time of publishing, but if you haven't picked up the game on console, PC, iOS, or PS VR2, this looks to be a good way to get everything in one neat package. 

Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

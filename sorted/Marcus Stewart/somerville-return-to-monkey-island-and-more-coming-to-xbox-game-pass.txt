Adventure game enthusiasts can dive into Return to Monkey Island as well as Pentiment, the new medieval mystery title by Obsidian Entertainment. The hit PC title Vampire Survivors also makes its console debut on Xbox this month. See what’s coming and what’s leaving Game Pass below, and check out our reviews for applicable titles.

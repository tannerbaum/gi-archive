  You Can Play Tekken 8 In A Closed Network Test Next Month






            Bandai Namco is inviting players to throwdown in Tekken 8 for the first time with a pair of closed network tests next month.

The tests lets players duke it out with 16 fighters across five stages. You’ll have to register at the official website before June 27 to participate, and the tests take place over two weekends, with PlayStation 5 players getting first dibs.

Week 1 - July 21 -24 (PlayStation 5)
Week 2 - July 28-31 (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC)

Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a launch date, but you can check out our impressions from our last hands-on look at the game here.

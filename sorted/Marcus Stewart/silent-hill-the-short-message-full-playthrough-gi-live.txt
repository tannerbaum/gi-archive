  Silent Hill: The Short Message (Full Playthrough) | GI Live






            Silent Hill: The Short Message shadow dropped yesterday following the conclusion of the PlayStation State of Play for the affordable price of free-ninety-free. The PS5-exclusive adventure follows a troubled teenager named Anita as she searches for her friend Maya in a decidedly not-okay apartment building. From the first-person perspective to psychological tricks and an oppressive atmosphere, The Short Message sports heavy P.T. vibes. If that sounds too terrifying, or if you don't own a PS5, you can watch me play the brief adventure from start to finish in this archived live stream.

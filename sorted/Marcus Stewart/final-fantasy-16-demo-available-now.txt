  Final Fantasy 16 Demo Available Now






            In case you missed it, yesterday’s Final Fantasy XVI Pre-Launch Celebration event delivered the announcement of a playable demo for the upcoming action RPG that you can play right now.

Dubbed the Playable Prologue, the demo consists of two big slices of the game. The first section is the 2+ hour-long opening prologue, in which your save data will carry over to the full game when it launches later this month.

The second segment is a  2-hour long action-focused mission centering on Clive’s infiltration of a fort. While the progress from this section will not transfer to the final game, it does provide a hefty sample of the game’s stylish-action-inspired combat. 

Final Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. The game graces Game Informer’s cover this month, and you can read a month’s worth of exclusive features about the game by visiting our coverage hub.

  Hellboy: Web Of Wyrd Punches In This October






            October is already the most stacked month for releases, and Mike Mignola’s Hellboy: Web of Wyrd joins the pack. The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.

The game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. 

Web of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements.

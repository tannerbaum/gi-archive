  Dave The Diver Serves Guests On PlayStation Next Week






            Last year’s acclaimed Dave the Diver is coming to PlayStation next week on April 16. The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.

Dave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to "sense the movements of the deep sea." The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. 

Dave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.

As editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, "You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying."

Dave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.

  PlayStation State Of Play Airs This Week, Includes New Look At Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League






            PlayStation will air its first State of Play presentation of 2023 on Thursday, February 23. The event will spotlight PlayStation VR2, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and more.

The event begins at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern on Twitch and YouTube and will reveal five new PSVR2 titles. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like we should expect anything first-party related. The announcement tweet states that third-party titles and indies will get a bulk of the spotlight. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which launches in May, will also have an in-depth segment with extended footage.

State of Play is back! Tune in Thursday at 1pm PT for:
☑️ Five new PS VR2 titles from partners
☑️ Hot indie and third-party reveals
☑️ An extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leaguehttps://t.co/kMPyPpMhSk pic.twitter.com/mu8RX0ZJFk

The event comes during a big week for Sony, as PlayStation VR2 launches on Wednesday, February 22 (check out our review of the headset here). We last saw Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at the Game Awards last December, where it was confirmed to launch on May 26 and will feature Kevin Conroy's final video game performance as Batman. Perhaps we'll get confirmation on the game's rumored live-service elements.

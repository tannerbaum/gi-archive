  Blasting Waves Of Eldritch Horrors In Kill Knight | New Gameplay Today






            Kill Knight has a simple, bloody premise. As an undead knight, you must slaughter waves of monsters using guns and a sword in pursuit of the last angel. This wave-based arcade-style shooter has a potent "one more run" hook as you try to ascend five levels while climbing the leaderboards, and we're intrigued to see more of it. Watch Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hillard battle hordes of beasts in this upcoming shooter.

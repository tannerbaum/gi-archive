  TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge Dimension Shellshock DLC Adds Usagi Yojimbo 






            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge keeps the ninja party going with the reveal of its Dimension Shellshock DLC. Launching later this year, this upcoming add-on takes the Turtles and their friends through time and space to take on new threats with the help of a familiar ally.

Ronin rabbit Usagi Yojimbo joins the game as a playable character. The samurai warrior has starred in his own self-titled comic series since the ‘80s, but many mainstream fans are likely familiar with him from his numerous crossover appearances in TMNT media over the decades. The trailer shows off Usagi’s formidable prowess with his katana, such as piercing through multiple foes with a single sword thrust. 

Dimension Shellshock also adds an unspecified new game mode, new tracks from composer Tee Lopes, and a fresh set of color schemes for the playable roster. Shredder’s Revenge is also getting another, separate free update that adds another batch of color palette options.

We’ll have to wait to learn more about Dimension Shellshock, but we’re excited to get our hands on it given the exceptional base game. You can read more about our thoughts on TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge by reading our review here.

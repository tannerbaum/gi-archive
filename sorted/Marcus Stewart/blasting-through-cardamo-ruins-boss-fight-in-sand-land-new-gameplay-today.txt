  Blasting Through Cardamo Ruins' Boss Fight In Sand Land | New Gameplay Today






            Sand Land comes from the mind of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, and despite the manga existing for over 20 years, it's never received a video game until now. Its epoynomous video game debut is a open world action RPG featuring an original story, and after fans got to try a recent public demo, we traveled to Bandai Namco to check out never-before-seen sections of the game. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off a new dungeon and boss fight from Sand Land, along with peeks at Forest Land and the game's deep vehicle customization.

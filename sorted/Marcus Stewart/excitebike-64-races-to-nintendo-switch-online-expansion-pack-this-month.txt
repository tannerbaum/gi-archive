  Excitebike 64 Races To Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack This Month






            Excitebike 64 is the latest classic game heading to the Nintendo 64 library of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Originally released in 2000, it arrives on the premium tier on August 30.

This sequel to Excitebike (already part of the Switch Online NES catalog and, funny enough, is included in 64 too) renders the action in full 3D with a selection of real-life dirt bike brands. Races unfold across 20 tracks, and the game also includes a Season mode. Check it out in action below.

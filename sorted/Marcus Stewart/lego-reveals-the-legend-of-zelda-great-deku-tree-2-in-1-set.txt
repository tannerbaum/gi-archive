  Lego Reveals The Legend Of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-In-1 Set






            Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.

The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games' versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.

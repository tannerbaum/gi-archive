  Ichiban Bares All In First Look At Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth






            Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the newly-subtitled 8th entry in the series formerly known as Yakuza, got a new trailer that showed off a lot more than we bargained for.

By that, we mean we got a very intimate look at Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga, who awakens on a beach seemingly with no idea as to how he got there. To make matters worse, he’s completely naked, a fact the shocked beachgoers waste no time bringing to his attention. Your guess is as good as ours as to what trouble the lovable ex-gang enforcer has gotten into this time.

  Yacht Club Games Reveals New Shovel Knight Updates Including A Brand New Game






            Yacht Club Games hosted its own Direct-style presentation today, primarily to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Shovel Knight. As such, the event featured various Shovel Knight-related announcements, including the reveal of a brand-new game.

This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. 

The studio also states, “We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.”

We’ll have to wait to see what this new game is, but the studio did reveal an enhanced version of the original game called Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX. This is essentially the definitive edition of the 2014 indie classic, featuring 20 new playable characters, a rewind function, save states, online multiplayer, cheats, and more. Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX has no release window or announced platforms. As for smaller updates, Yacht Club announced free DLC for Shovel Knight Dig (its final content pack) and Pocket Dungeon.

Yacht Club also provided an update for Mina the Hollower, its upcoming action-adventure game. A new trailer offers a montage of gameplay, and Yacht Club states the project is “nearing completion of the initial pass on all level content.” It plans to spend the next few months polishing and refining gameplay. Yacht Club reveals that the game has grown larger than expected since its reveal in 2022; it now features an “expansive” overworld and RPG elements. The studio says to expect a big gameplay reveal in the near future.

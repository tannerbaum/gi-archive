  Moon Studio’s No Rest for the Wicked Hits Early Access In April






            Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.

No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.

Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.

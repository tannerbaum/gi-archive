  Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer Weekend Betas Announced






            Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches in October, but players can get in early via a pair of open betas. Activision is running two of these beta periods during consecutive weekends, and the dates and times for each have been revealed. 

Here is when you can jump into each beta: 

Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers) - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT

Weekend 2: Open Beta (for everyone) - September 6 at 10 a.m. PT to September 9 at 10 a.m. PT

Both betas are multiplayer only and will feature several online modes, weapons, equipment, and perks for players to tinker with. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Set in 1991 during the Gulf War, the espionage-themed campaign centers on a mysterious organization's infiltration of the U.S. government. The Black Ops agents must go rogue to stop this threat, which takes players across the globe with new faces and returning favorites like Woods and Adler.

  Diablo IV Season Of Blood Revealed, Kicks Off In October






            Diablo IV's second season, Season of Blood, got its first reveal during Gamescom Opening Night Live. This free second season lets you become a vampire hunter sporting new vampiric powers to take down these bloodsucking invaders. 

You’ll team up with a new character, Erys, voiced by actress Gemma Chan (Eternals, Crazy Rich Asians), a seasoned warrior and vampire hunter who is described as complex and jaded, having experienced plenty of horror in her life. Season of the Blood is a brand-new questline featuring five new endgame bosses. Check out the teaser trailer below.  

Diablo IV Season of Blood begins on October 17. As a reminder, the game's currently ongoing Season of the Malignant wraps up on the same day.

  Open Roads | New Gameplay Today






            We're taking a road trip! Open Roads comes from an internal team, dubbed The Open Roads Team, within Fullbright (Gone Home, Tacoma) and tells a tale of a teenage girl and her mother embarking on a road trip to solve a tantalizing family mystery. The narrative adventure sports a unique mixed media art direction and the studio's trademark narrative-focused design. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off a slice of this long-awaited journey.

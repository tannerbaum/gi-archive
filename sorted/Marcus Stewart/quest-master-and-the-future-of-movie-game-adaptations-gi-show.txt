  Quest Master And The Future Of Movie Game Adaptations | GI Show






In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we played the "build your own Zelda" dungeon maker Quest Master, dived into Fortnite's new season of content (including Fallout), and revisited this year's remake of Mario vs. Donkey Kong. We also chatted about our love of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and reminisced about the 2015 Mad Max game, kicking off a discussion about the future of movie tie-in titles.

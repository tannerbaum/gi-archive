  Mario Red Nintendo Switch OLED Announced






            Today’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Direct spilled a lot of tea on the upcoming game (read about it here) and concluded with the reveal of a new Switch OLED model. If you love the color red, then Nintendo has a console for you. 

The Mario Red Edition Switch OLED is coated in the plumber’s classic shade of red and the dock even includes a couple of Mario silhouettes and hidden coins on the backside, as you can see in the photo below. 

The console does not include a copy of Wonder, mainly because it hits store shelves a couple of weeks beforehand on October 6. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, meanwhile, launches on October 20. Still, if you're a passionate Mario fan looking for an excuse to upgrade to an OLED model, this version will set you back $349.99.

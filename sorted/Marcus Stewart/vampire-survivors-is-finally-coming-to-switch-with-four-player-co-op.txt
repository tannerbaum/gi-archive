  Vampire Survivors Is Finally Coming To Switch With Four-Player Co-Op






            Vampire Survivors, one of 2022’s best games, has dominated multiple platforms, but fans have clamored for it to come to Switch since its arrival. That wish will finally be granted on August 17.

The best vampire bullet hell with no vampires has scooped up numerous rewards for its satisfying, hard-to-put-down action and gameplay loop. It's a great fit for a handheld (as Steam Deck players will attest). Best of all, this version supports four-player couch co-op. Check out the new trailer below.

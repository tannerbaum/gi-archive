  The Big List Of Upcoming Video Game Remakes 






            Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 

The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window. This will be an evolving list that will be updated as new remakes are announced and released, so be sure to keep an eye on it over the coming months. 

            Alone in the Dark

            Release: October 25

            The 1992 survival-horror classic is being dusted off and reimagined. Now a third-person adventure game, players explore the haunted Dercerto Manor as either Emily Hartwood or detective Edward Carnby (portrayed by actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, respectively) in two unique campaigns. Along the way, they'll encounter supernatural threats and a bevy of elaborate puzzles, and fans can expect to find multiple references to the original. 

            Star Ocean: The Second Story R

            Release: November 2

            1998's Star Ocean: The Second Story gets its turn under the HD-2D remake machine. However, this is more than just a visual upgrade. The real-time combat gets additions such as enemy-stunning chain attacks and the ability to summon non-combat party members to lend helpful assists. 

            Super Mario RPG

            Release: November 17

            Mario's first and much-beloved RPG outing gets a glow-up that, far as we can tell, faithfully retains its gameplay and charm. The plumber, along with Peach, Geno, Mallow, and Bowser, must stop the Smithy Gang from taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. If all bodes well, any success this remake garners will hopefully translate into an eventual sequel. 

            Front Mission

            2 Remake (2023), 3 Remake (TBA)    

            Forever Entertainment answered the wishes of Front Mission fans by announcing plans to remake not one, not two, but the series’ first three games. Front Mission 1st Remake landed on Switch in November 2022 and features modernized controls and a reorchestrated soundtrack. 2nd and 3rd Remake will likely get the same treatment, and hopefully, these games will wash away Left Alive’s bad taste. 

            Lollipop Chainsaw

            Release: 2023

            2012’s Lollipop Chainsaw may not have been a critical darling or a commercial hit, but that’s not stopping publisher Dragami Games from remaking the zany action title. Fans hoping for a Resident Evil or Final Fantasy-caliber update should temper their expectations, however. 

Though billed as a full remake, Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda (who produced the original game) stated it will be “as close as possible to a remaster.” He explains the goal is to make Lollipop Chainsaw playable to a new audience rather than reinvent it. The title features overhauled graphics but lacks many of the original’s licensed songs. Co-creators Suda51 and Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn will also not be involved. Despite these caveats, maybe Juliet’s second zombified go-around can prove more successful than her first.

            Risk of Rain Returns

            Release: 2023

            Risk of Rain turns 10 years old in 2023, and developer Hopoo Games is celebrating by remaking and improving the popular action platformer. Dubbed Risk of Rain Returns, the new game sports an HD paint job, new survivors, a revamped multiplayer, fresh music tracks, and the design improvements of Risk of Rain 2. 

            Final Fantasy VII Rebirth

            Release: 2024

            Final Fantasy VII Remake’s second installment moves beyond Midgar and into uncharted territory. Sure, we’re likely to visit established locations like the Gold Saucer and encounter new versions of old friends, but Rebirth’s story can go a multitude of new directions based on Remake’s events. We’re excited to see what shake-ups Square Enix has in store as long as the snowboarding mini-game remains intact. 

            Persona 3 Reload

            Release: 2024

            Persona 3 is the game that transformed the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off series into the popular animal it is today, and it's being remade from the ground up in the Unreal Engine. It's being stuffed with features such as a revamped presentation and gameplay that hews closer to Persona 5, a new English voiceover, and additional side stories fleshing out the cast. Reload is billed as a remake of the original version of Persona 3, so while it still retains the narrative changes from Persona 3 FES, it will not include the female protagonist option from the PSP version. 

            Silent Hill 2

            Release: TBA

            Bloober Team is reviving Silent Hill 2 with a modern coat of paint. The minds behind Layers of Fear and The Medium may not have the greatest critical track record, but hopefully, working with an established (and better) template will yield more positive results. It would be nice to have a good modernized version of Silent Hill 2 after the less-than-stellar HD port from 2012. Silent Hill 2’s release window remains shrouded in fog, but it will come to PC and PlayStation 5 as a timed console exclusive. 

            Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

            Release: TBA

            The reveal that arguably the best Star Wars game ever was getting a much-needed remake had fans raising their lightsabers in celebration. Unfortunately, the game’s development may have already succumbed to the dark side. It’s been reported, though not yet confirmed, that progress had stalled, and work on the game has switched hands from Aspyr Media to Saber Interactive. Allegedly, Lucasfilm was unhappy with an internal demo, which brought development to a screeching halt for a period (and led to the firing of two directors). Whatever the case, we hope KOTOR can get back on track and eventually see the light of day. 

            Splinter Cell

            Release: TBA

            It might not be a new entry, but a remake of Sam Fisher’s first outing is better than nothing after years of waiting. Ubisoft Toronto sits at the helm of the project and plans to rebuild the game from scratch using the Snowdrop Engine while maintaining the classic stealth elements. Outside of recently losing its director (on good terms), it’s unclear how development is faring or when we’ll get to see this fresh spin on the franchise. 

            Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time

            Release: TBA

            Development has been rocky for The Sands of Time’s impending remake, to say the least. Besides the game’s reveal garnering backlash from fans due to its unimpressive graphics, it has been delayed twice: first by two months, then indefinitely. In hindsight, it’s wild to think we were supposed to be playing this in January 2021. In May 2022, Ubisoft announced it had moved development from its fledgling Indian studios back to Montreal, where The Sands of Time was first created. While it's unfortunate that Ubisoft Pune/Mumbai couldn’t bring the remake together, we’re excited to see if Ubisoft Montreal can reapply the same magic. 

            Dragon Quest III: HD-2D Remake 

            Release: TBA

            HD-2D is becoming an increasingly popular template for reviving classic JRPGs. It worked wonders for Live A Live, and Square Enix is giving Dragon Quest III the same treatment. For now, we know next to nothing about the game other than that it’s coming to consoles at a yet-to-be-specified window.

            Max Payne 1 and 2

            Release: TBA

            In April, Remedy Entertainment pleasantly surprised the gaming world when it announced it had struck a deal with Rockstar Games to remake Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. Remedy sold the IP to Rockstar in 2002, but the two are partnering to revive the gritty crime series that popularized bullet time. The games will be made by Remedy, with Rockstar footing the bill on development and publishing, and target current-gen consoles and PC. 

            Gothic

            Release: TBA

            2001's Gothic is getting a faithful glow-up that looks to reintroduce the RPG to a new audience. The combat system and control scheme, a criticism of the original, has been reworked to feel modern and, most of all, playable. Developer THQ Nordic Barcelona even released a playable teaser to obtain feedback and ensure it's on the right track. As 20+ year-old game, Gothic has been a tough game to revisit on PC, making this remake all the more welcomed. 

            The Witcher

            Release: TBA

            CD Projekt Red’s litany of upcoming projects includes a full remake of the first Witcher game. It’s being built in Unreal Engine 5 by developer Fool’s Theory (with supervision from CD Projekt veterans) and is said to be very early in development. The Witcher, released for PC in 2007, isn’t the easiest game to revisit due to its age and lack of console ports. Now that Geralt and friends are mainstream draws, newer fans can finally experience the adventure that started it all. 

            Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater

            Release: TBA

            Months of rumors proved true when Konami revealed it was remaking arguably the most beloved entry in the Metal Gear series, Snake Eater. Boasting, as Konami put it, "cutting-edge graphics and 3D audio," this new version will faithfully retell the story of Big Boss' origin. Best of all, the iconic theme song is back in full force.

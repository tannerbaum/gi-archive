  Battle Mechs In Battle Royale Or Alongside Friends In Mecha Break






            Mecha Break is an new multiplayer co-op mech game by Seasun Games that premiered during The Game Awards tonight. Fans of games like Armored Core VI and Zone of the Enders may want to keep it on their radar. 

The game puts you in the cockpit of a variety of mech suits, which you can customize the look and weapons of, to take on other players across a variety of modes. The biggest battlefield is a 48-player battle royale. If you’d rather play alongside friends, a co-op option allows three-to-six players to team up to complete specialized missions. Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.

Mecha Break currently has no release window or announced platforms.

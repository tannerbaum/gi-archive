  League Of Legends Fighting Game Project L Renamed 2XKO And Gets New Trailer






            Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.

The 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. 

2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game's official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.

  Void Bastards Follow-Up Wild Bastards Announced






            Wild Bastards is a new roguelite space western and follow-up to 2019’s Void Bastards. The game was announced during today’s PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted showcase, and it’s coming next year. 

Like its predecessor, Wild Bastards sports a stylized comic book-inspired presentation and blends first-person shooting with roguelite progression. A puritanical villain known as Jebediah Chaste has wiped out nearly all of the Bastards with only two surviving thanks to a rescue by a sentient ship called The Drifter. To strike back, you’ll assemble a gang of 13 playable outlaws, each with their own progression trees, to plot your path of revenge through the galaxy.

Wild Bastards’ loop involves visiting planets to commit heists and engage in shootouts using a variety of weapons and perks to take down anyone in the way. See it in action in the trailer below. 

Wild Bastards is currently slated for PC and will arrive in 2024.

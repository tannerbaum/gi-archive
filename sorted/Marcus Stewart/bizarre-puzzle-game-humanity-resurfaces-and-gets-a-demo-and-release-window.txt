  Bizarre Puzzle Game Humanity Resurfaces And Gets A Demo And Release Window






            The mysterious population puzzle game Humanity has been shrouded in mystery since it was first announced in 2018, but today’s State of Play presentation revealed it’s coming this summer. Best of all, you can play a demo today.

The game comes from the creators of Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite and centers on controlling a dog to herd thousands of people across bizarre platforming challenges. The trailer also revealed tools to create your own levels and share them with other players. 

Humanity launches this May for PlayStation consoles, PlayStation VR and VR2, and PC via Steam. The demo is available now until March 6.

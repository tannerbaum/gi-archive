  Avatar: The Last Airbender Skins Now Available In Fortnite






            After Korra of The Legend of Korra fame made her debut in Fortnite this season, her predecessors have now joined her. Avatar: The Last Airbender’s Aang, Katara, Zuko, and Toph land in Fortnite this week. 

Katara, Zuko, and Toph are available for purchase now. These additions coincide with the Avatar: Elements event that begins Friday, April 12, at 9 a.m. ET.

Although Aang doesn't fully appear in the trailer, he'll become available as part of the event pass (thanks, Forbes) with he and Toph looking a bit taller than they do on the show (likely to fit the game's hitboxes). Aang also comes with a separate Avatar State skin. 

If you haven't caught up on Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, here's a full breakdown of everything the season entails.

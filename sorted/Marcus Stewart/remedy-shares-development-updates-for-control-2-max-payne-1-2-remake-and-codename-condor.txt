  Remedy Shares Development Updates For Control 2, Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake, And Codename Condor






            Remedy has provided updates on its portfolio of upcoming titles via a quarterly business review. In addition to painting the overall financial health of the studio, the report shares details on the current development state of Control 2, Max Payne 1&2 Remake, the Control multiplayer spin-off Codename Condor, and more.

According to the report, the Control 2 team is “focused on finalizing the proof-of-concept stage, in which the game world, game mechanics and visual targets are proven.” The project is expected to move into the production readiness stage in Q2 of this year. Control 2 was first announced in 2022. 

Max Payne 1&2 Remake, first announced in 2022 as a rebuilt version that combines both games into a single title, remains in the production readiness stage, as first announced last October. However, the game is expected to enter full production in Q2 2024.

Codename Condor has entered full production. Remedy describes its core loop as “engaging” and that “the game brings a unique Remedy angle to the genre.” Codename Kestral, Remedy’s other multiplayer title described as a “premium game with a strong, cooperative multiplayer component”, remains in the concept stage. 

Remedy also shares that Alan Wake 2 has sold 1.3 million units as of early February, recouping a “significant” chunk of its development and marketing expenses in the process. The development team continues to work on its upcoming expansions, Night Springs and Lake House. 

Following Remedy’s acquisition of the rights to Control from publisher 505 Games in February, the studio is now free to do what it wants with the IP. CEO Tero Virtala states, “We are currently weighing self-publishing and related business models. Simultaneously, we are actively looking into different partner publishing models and evaluating potential partners.” Remedy also expects to have two projects in full production simultaneously, stating "We are confident that the good progress of the beginning of the year carries over to the full production stages."

  San Francisco 49ers’ Christian McCaffrey Graces Madden NFL 25 Cover






            Madden NFL 25 (the new one, not the bizarrely titled 25th-anniversary entry of the same name from 2013) has found its cover athlete. Hot off his run to a near-victory in Super Bowl LVIII comes San Francisco 49er running back Christian McCaffrey.

The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.

EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon." 

Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year's Madden NFL 24 here. For the first time in years, Madden won't be EA's only licensed football sim this year, as EA Sports College Football makes its comeback on July 19. You can watch the first trailer here.

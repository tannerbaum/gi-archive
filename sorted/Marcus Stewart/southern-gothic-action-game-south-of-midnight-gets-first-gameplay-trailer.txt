  Southern Gothic Action Game South Of Midnight Gets First Gameplay Trailer And 2025 Launch Window






            South of Midnight, Compulsion Games' (We Happy Few, Contrast) next third-person adventure first revealed last year, received an extended look at gameplay during the Xbox Games Showcase. Set in a fantastical world inspired by the Louisiana Bayou, the game is expected to be released sometime next year. 

The trailer's description describes South of Midnight's premise: "When a hurricane rips through Prospero, Hazel is pulled into a Southern Gothic world where reality and fantasy are interwoven, and ancient creatures from folklore emerge." We see that as Hazel rides through the bayou-inspired swamp atop a giant, talking catfish. The beautiful art direction combined with the limited-frame animation (think the Spider-verse films) gives the game a distinct look, while a soul-infused soundtrack evokes the culture of the region. The action shows Hazel fighting off monsters with magic-infused daggers and soaring though the sky on an ethreal glider.

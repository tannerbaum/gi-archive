  Exploring The Oceanview Hotel In Alan Wake 2 (Alan Gameplay) | New Gameplay Today






            Alan Wake 2 stars dual protagonists – Alan Wake and Saga Anderson – and we're taking a look at Alan's side of the story! Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off a nice slice of the upcoming game and give hands-on impressions from playing it. This demo unfolds a few chapters into the game and sees the tortured author explore the sinister Oceanview Hotel in search of an escape from The Dark Place. Get a look at new mechanics such as Alan's Dark Place Lamp and the ability to "rewrite" his surroundings using narrative elements.

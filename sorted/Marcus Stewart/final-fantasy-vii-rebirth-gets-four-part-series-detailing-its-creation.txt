  Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Gets Four-Part Series Detailing Its Creation






            If you finished Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and are curious to learn more about how it came to be, Sony and Square Enix have released a new making-of series called Inside Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The four-part series features interviews with thirty of the game's lead designers, such as director Naoki Hamaguchi, creative director Tetsuya Nomura, and producer Yoshinori Kitase, who discuss how Square brought Rebirth to life.

Each episode tackles different aspects of Rebirth. Episode 1 focuses on world-building, Episode 2 covers the story/cutscenes, Episode 3 is all about the characters and combat, and Episode 4 tackles the English voice actors. Each episode runs between 15-18 minutes. You can watch the first episode below.

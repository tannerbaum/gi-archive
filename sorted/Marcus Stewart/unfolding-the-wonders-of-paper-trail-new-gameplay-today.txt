  Unfolding The Wonders Of Paper Trail | New Gameplay Today






            Paper Trail is a neat upcoming indie game, especially if you're into papercraft. The adventure stars Paige (get it?), a young girl with the power to fold reality like it's made out of paper. She uses this ability to run away from home in pursuit of her dreams, with players solving origami-focused pathfinding puzzles to get her from one scenic locale to the next. Join editors Marcus Stewart, Kyle Hilliard, and Wesley LeBlanc as they take a look at the opening chapter of this pleasant and mind-bending journey.

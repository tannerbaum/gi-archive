  RoboCop: Rogue City Begins Its Mission In November






            Publisher Nacon has rolled out a new trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City while also announcing a November 2 release date in a press release (a delay from its original September window). First announced in 2021 and based on the original film trilogy, players step into the metallic boots of RoboCop to protect Detroit from its criminal underground. 

Actor Peter Weller reprises his role as the titular hero, and a new trailer provides a glimpse into the game’s supporting players. We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche.

Naturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. 

RoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

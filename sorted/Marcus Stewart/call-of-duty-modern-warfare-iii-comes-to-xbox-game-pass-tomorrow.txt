  Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare III Comes To Xbox Game Pass Tomorrow






            Last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, July 24. This marks the next big Activision Blizzard title to join the service. 

The move comes less than a year after Modern Warfare III launched last November and represents the fruit of Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. It’s also the biggest AB title to appear on Game Pass since Diablo IV was added to the library in March.

This gives subscribers a chance to check out last year’s entry before 2024’s installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, launches on Game Pass on October 25. It also comes ahead of the new Game Pass price increases and subscription tier arriving in September, a move the FTC has taken issue with.

  Supernatural Action Strategy Game Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Launches In July






            Capcom's upcoming action strategy game Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess has a new trailer and, perhaps more importantly, a release date. The game will be released on July 19. 

The new trailer offers a brief highlight real of the fantastical action game, which sees players prepare a Japanese village by day for an otherworldly assault by demons at night. The game blends stylish action with real-time strategy elements as you'll take on massive, bizarre creatures to cleanse the mountain of defilement. 

You watch a more in-depth trailer from March's Xbox Partner Showcase. Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

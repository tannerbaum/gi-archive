  Don’t Nod’s Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden Arrives In November






            Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an upcoming action RPG from Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Vampyr, which was first revealed at The Game Awards last December. The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. 

The game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.

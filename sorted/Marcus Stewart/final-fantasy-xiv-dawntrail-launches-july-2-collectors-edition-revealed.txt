  Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Launches July 2, Collector’s Edition Revealed






            Dawntrail, the fifth expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is coming on July 2. The game is also getting a collector’s edition.  

The $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions. 

During PAX East this past weekend, FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida unveiled the Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition and the goodies-filled physical Collector’s Box. Here’s what comes in each package: 

Collector’s Box ($155.00)

Dawntrail Special Art Box 
Expertly Crafted Viper Figure (H 9.65" x W 4.52" x D 5.90"/H 24.5cm x W 11.5cm x D 15cm)
Adventurer’s Cloth Map (16.53" x 29.52"/42cm x 75cm)
The Unending Journey Notebook (5.90" x 4.33"/15cm x 11cm)
Adventurer’s Pen Case (8.26" x 9.44"/21cm x 24cm)

Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition ($59.99)

In-game Item: Ark Mount 
In-game Item: Garnet Minion 
In-game Item: Chocobo Brush: Pictomancer Weapon 

While the Digital Collector's Edition and Collector's Box must be purchased separately, a bundle containing both is called the Dawntrail Collector's Edition and runs for $214.99. However, it only contains a game code for the Windows/Mac version of Dawntrail. 

Pre-orders for the standard and collector's edition items begin Tuesday, March 26, at 9 a.m. PT. Doing so at certain retailers grants the bonus in-game items: Wind-up Zidane Minion and Azeyma's Earrings.

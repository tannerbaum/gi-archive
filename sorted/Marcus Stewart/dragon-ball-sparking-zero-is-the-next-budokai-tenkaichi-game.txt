  Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero Is The Next Budokai Tenkaichi Game






            Bandai Namco has revealed the title of the new Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi game called Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero during The Game Awards. 

The trailer sees Goku and Vegeta doing the one thing they know how to do: fight each other. The battle escalates to the pair powering up to Super Saiyan Blue, but we also get looks at Freiza and Broly (the new version of him). The game is the next entry in the long dormant Budokai Tenkaichi series and was announced back in March without an official title. 

Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero doesn't have a release date but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

  God of War Ragnarök Gets A Free Expansion Called Valhalla Next Week






            God of War Ragnarök fans got three surprises at The Game Awards. One, the game is getting an expansion. Two, it drops next week. And three, it's free. 

The expansion, called Valhalla, will be totally free. We see Kratos and Mimir traveling to an unknown where he battles the usual Norse creatures but also threats from his past, such as cyclops and undead Greek soldiers. PlayStation's official synopsis, posted below, describes the adventure as featuring some kind of roguelite element, but it is currently unclear what that means exactly. 

Embark with Kratos to Valhalla on a deeply personal and reflective journey towards a future he never thought possible. Master challenges of mind and body on an unraveling adventure that blends the beloved combat from God of War Ragnarök with brand new elements inspired by the roguelite genre.

God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla arrives on December 12 for both the PS5 and PS4 versions of the game.

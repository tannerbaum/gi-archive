  Super Mario Bros. Wonder Is The Next 2D Mario Platformer






            Today’s Nintendo Direct ended with the reveal of a new 2D Mario game called Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Before you ask, this is not a new “New” Super Mario Bros. This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.

The 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous. 

Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a trip, and it launches on October 20.

  FFXIV: Dawntrail Impressions, Infinity Nikki Beta, And Alan Wake 2's Night Springs DLC | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, former GI editor and current writer for The Indie Informer John Carson drops by to share his impressions of Final Fantasy XIV's newly released Dawntrail expansion. We're also joined by our wonderful podcast editor Matt Storm to give their thoughts on Alan Wake 2's Night Springs DLC, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and their first foray into Sam Barlow's Immortality. Marcus Stewart spills the tea on his time playing the closed beta for the bubbly open-world dress up game Infinity Nikki and his first excursion through the typing-based dungeon crawler Cryptmaster. We round the show with Kyle Hillard and Marcus giving their obligatory Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree check-ins.

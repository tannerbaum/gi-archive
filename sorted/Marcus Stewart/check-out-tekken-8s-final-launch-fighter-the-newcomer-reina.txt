  Check Out Tekken 8’s Final Launch Fighter, The Newcomer Reina






            After months of character reveals, Tekken 8 has announced the final fighter of its launch roster: Reina. This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning," and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.

Bandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School. For some reason, she really wants to fight Jin (move over, Hwoarang), and based on her gameplay trailer, she seems more than capable of taking him on. Check Reina out in action below. 

With Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:

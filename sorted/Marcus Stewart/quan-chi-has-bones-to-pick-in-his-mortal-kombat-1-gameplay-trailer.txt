  Quan Chi Has Bones To Pick In His Mortal Kombat 1 Gameplay Trailer






            Next week, Mortal Kombat 1 is getting its second DLC fighter in the form of the Nether Realm’s favorite wizard, Quan Chi. His gameplay trailer makes no bones about the fact that he’s an extremely formidable fighter.

Quan Chi sports his usual arsenal of necromancy-based offense, such as summoning skeletons and firing skulls, but he can now conjure giant tentacles from presumably another reality. He also tag teams with upcoming Kameo fighter Khameleon, who becomes available in January. We particularly enjoy seeing Quan Chi and Shang Tsung make perhaps the most delightfully eye-rolling Deadly Alliance reference ever, plus the bonus tease of another impending guest fighter, Peacemaker, who arrives in February.  

Owners of Mortal Kombat 1’s Premium Edition or Kombat Pack get access to Quan Chi early on December 14. Everyone else will have to wait until December 21. Quan Chi follows Invincible’s Omni-Man, who hit the game last month, on the DLC character roadmap, leaving Ermac, Takeda, Peacemaker, and The Boys’ Homelander.

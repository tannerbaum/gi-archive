  Hellblade II, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door Reviews, Exploring Manor Lords | GI Show






            In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we unpack our reviews of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and the "more than a remaster but not quite a remake" of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. We also share our first foray into the hit early access city-builder, Manor Lords, and give our impressions of exciting new indies such as Hauntii, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, Baladins, and 1000xResist.

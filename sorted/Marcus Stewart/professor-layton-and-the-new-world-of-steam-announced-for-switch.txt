  Professor Layton And The New World Of Steam Announced For Switch






            Professor Layton is making a comeback in a new adventure for Switch. Called Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, the next chapter in his saga will arrive at a yet-to-be-specified date.

A brief teaser trailer shows the professor trotting through an industrial backdrop. We don't know what mystery he'll unravel or which allies will lend a hand, but it's nice to see the good gentleman back.

  GTFO Makers Announces New Co-op Heist Title, Den Of Wolves






            10 Chambers, the studio behind the hit shooter GTFO, has another game in the works called Den of Wolves. It announced the project at The Game Awards, and it's a co-op heist first-person shooter.

Den of Wolves sees players working together as criminals-for-hire working for rival corporations in Midway City. You'll assemble a crew, outfit yourselves in gear, and plan what will hopefully be a successful heist. Hopefully. 

Den of Wolves is coming to PC via Steam but has no release window.

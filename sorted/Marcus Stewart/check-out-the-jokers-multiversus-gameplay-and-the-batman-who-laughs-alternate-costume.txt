  Check Out The Joker's MultiVersus Gameplay And The Batman Who Laughs Alternate Costume






            Last week, The Joker was announced as the first new fighter joining MultiVersus ahead of its upcoming relaunch this month. The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today’s new trailer shows off his gameplay.

The video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill’s new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn. 

MultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.

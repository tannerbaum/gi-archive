  The PlayStation Plus Collection Disappears In May






            Sony is closing the PlayStation Plus Collection, the batch of PS4 essentials that PS Plus subscribers on PS5 could download and play for no extra charge. 

In an email sent to subscribers, the message states that on May 9, the 19-game collection will disappear, and subscribers have until that date to add its games to their game library. Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:

From May 9 the PlayStation Plus Collection will no longer be available as a PlayStation Plus benefit. You can add any of the titles from the PlayStation Plus Collection to your Game Library before May 9 and play at any time in the future with an active PlayStation Plus membership.

PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, Monthly Games and other existing benefits will not be affected by this change.

Thank you for your continued support of PlayStation Plus.

The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: 

Batman: Arkham Knight
Battlefield 1
Bloodborne
Call of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition
Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy
Days Gone
Detroit: Become Human
Fallout 4
Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition
God of War (2018)
Infamous: Second Son
The Last Guardian
The Last of Us Remastered
Monster Hunter: World
Mortal Kombat X
Ratchet & Clank (2016)
Resident Evil VII: Biohazard
Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
Until Dawn

Last year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.

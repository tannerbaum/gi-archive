  Metal Slug Tactics Reemerges With A New Trailer And Fall Release Window






            It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.

The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.

Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. 

When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

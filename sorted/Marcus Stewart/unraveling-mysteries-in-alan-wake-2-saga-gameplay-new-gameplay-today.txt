  Unraveling Mysteries In Alan Wake 2 (Saga Gameplay) | New Gameplay Today






            Alan Wake 2 stars dual protagonists – Alan Wake and Saga Anderson – and we're taking a look at Saga's side of the story! We played Alan Wake 2 at a recent preview event, and this video shows off a slice of Saga's investigation of a cult in the small fishing town of Watery. The demo also features a combat sequence through a coffee-themed amusement park as the editors provide hands-on impressions of the action as it unfolds. 

Be sure to read our in-depth preview of this demo here and check out our thoughts on Alan's section by reading this preview and watching this NGT.

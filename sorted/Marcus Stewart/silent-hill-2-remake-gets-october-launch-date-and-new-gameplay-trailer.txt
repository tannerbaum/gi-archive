  Silent Hill 2 Remake Gets October Launch Date And New Gameplay Trailer






            The remake of Silent Hill 2 has a new trailer and a release date of October 8. Surprisingly, this news comes during Sony’s State of Play instead of the Silent Hill Transmission airing later tonight. 

Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved. 

Silent Hill 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive as well as PC.

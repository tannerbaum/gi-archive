  Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack Pricing Revealed






            Today’s Animal Crossing Direct detailed New Horizon's first paid expansion, Happy Home Paradise. It also, unexpectedly, confirmed the pricing for the previously announced expansion to Nintendo Switch Online, which gives players access to Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis titles.

An individual 12-month membership costs $49.99 annually, while a family membership runs for $79.99. For comparison, 12-month single and family memberships for the current tier of NSO cost $19.99/$34.99, respectively. Although the now-basic tier of NSO has options for one and three-month memberships, the Expansion Pack only offers 12-months. You can read the full list of N64 and Genesis games that will be available here. 

Nintendo also revealed that the Happy Home Paradise expansion will be part of the upgraded subscription tier. That means Animal Crossing: New Horizons players can access the DLC content as long as their subscription is active. You can also purchase the DLC outright for $24.99 to own permanently. 

The Expansion Pack’s release window is still labeled as “coming soon,” but with Happy Home Paradise launching November 5, that may narrow the gap on when players can expect its launch. On the same day as Happy Home Paradise's launch, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is also getting its final, free update which you can read all about here.

  Mortal Kombat 1 | New Gameplay Today






            Mortal Kombat 1 represents a bloody new era for the long-running franchise, and editors Marcus Stewart and Brian Shea have gone hands-on with it, most recently in this past weekend's online stress test. In this video, we take a look at the gameplay captured from this period that provides good looks at the movements and fatalities of the test's four available fighters, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, Kitana, and Kenshi. You'll also get to watch those kombatants team up with three Kameo fighters: Kano, Sonya, and Jax. 

For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about new and upcoming games such as Eternights, Crash Team Rumble, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.

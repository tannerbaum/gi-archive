  The League Of Upcoming Superhero Games






            Look up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! No, it’s a superhero game – several of them! Fans of spandex-clad saviors have several titles based on their favorite comic heroes to look out for, regardless if you love DC, Marvel, or (preferably) both. We’ve gathered the biggest announced superhero titles and arranged them in chronological release order to know when to expect these games to swoop in and rescue you from boredom. 

            Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra

            Release: 2025

            Some predicted Skydance's big Marvel project to be Fantastic Four-related, but we're getting something entirely different – and exciting – instead. The team led by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig is working on a World War II adventure starring Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, grandfather of T'Challa. The superheroes will battle Nazis/Hydra alongside the Howling Commandos' Gabriel Jones and Wakandan spy, Nanali. Despite featuring four protagonists, this yet-to-be-titled project will be a linear single-player adventure that offers different viewpoints on the war. We don't know much more about the game, but we're excited to learn more, hopefully, sooner than later. 

            Marvel's Wolverine

            Release: TBA

            Not content with only tackling Spider-Man, Insomniac shocked the gaming world by announcing it’s also making a Wolverine game. We know little about this exciting project outside of a brief cinematic teaser trailer. Insomniac confirmed it will have a mature tone and that it takes place in the same universe as its Spider-Man games. Eagle-eyed fans also found subtle easter eggs in the trailer hinting at the Hulk. We have a good while before we get any answers as the game is very early in development and has no release window. 

            Wonder Woman

            Release: TBA

            At long last, the most iconic superheroine ever is getting a standalone video game. Announced during the 2021 Game Awards, Wonder Woman is being developed by Monolith, the team behind F.E.A.R. and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War. So far, we know the game is an open-world single-player adventure powered by Middle-earth's revolutionary Nemesis System. Whether or not the plot serves as an origin story set on Diana's home island of Themyscira or unfolds across multiple locations in "Man's World" is unclear. We only hope that Monolith gives Wonder Woman's long overdue game the royal treatment it deserves. 

            Motive Studio's Iron Man Game

            Release: TBA

            Motive Studio, the team behind Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake, has an untitled Iron Man game in the works. This third-person, single-player action game aims to capture, per Motive, "the complexity, charisma, and creative genius of Tony Stark, enabling players to feel what it's like to truly play as Iron Man." The game's line-up includes executive producer Olivier Proulx, who served as producer on the well-received Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Motive announced the game as being in pre-production, meaning it will likely be a long while before we see any actual footage of it. Iron Man will also be the first game of a longer partnership between EA and Marvel. 

            Cliffhanger's Black Panther Game

            Release: TBA

            EA and the fledging studio Cliffhanger Games are giving Black Panther fans something they've never gotten: a video game dedicated to the king of Wakanda. Described as a story-driven third-person action game, we won't see the fruits of the Cliffhanger's efforts for years as the project was announced while very early in development. But the studio consists of veteran game designers with experience working on titles such as God of War and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, so here's hoping that expertise results in an adventure worthy of the Black Panther mantle. 

            Marvel's Blade

            Release: TBA

            Arkane Lyon, the studio behind the Dishonored series and Deathloop, is taking a big swing by tackling its first licensed superhero game. Of all the heroes it could have chosen, we're pleasantly surprised it chose Marvel's resident vampire hunter. In another first for the studio, the game will be a third-person adventure that sees Blade using his, well, blade to cut down hordes of vampires taking over Paris. Tack on the high likelihood of Arkane implementing its signature immersive sim elements, and we can't wait to take a bite out of this one. 

            Marvel Rivals

            Release: TBA

            What happens when you spill a bucketload of Marvel into a bowl of Overwatch? You get Marvel Rivals. This 6v6 team-based shooter gathers heroes from across the multiverse – from iconic faces like Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Avengers to cult favorites like Peni Parker and Luna Snow – to throw down in chaotic multiplayer battles. Like Overwatch, team synergy matters as players use each hero's unique abilities to concoct effective strategies to gain an advantage. Arenas modeled after recognizable Marvel locations feature destructible elements, allowing players to use the terrain to their advantage. 

            Those are the most exciting super hero games on the horizon, but which one are you most excited for?

  Everything Announced During The April 2024 Nintendo Indie World 






            Today's Nintendo Indie World featured 20 minutes of new indie game reveals and updates to anticipated titles. If you missed the event, we've gathered each announcement here for a cursory glance at what showed up. 

Little Kitty, Big City - May 9 

As the title suggests, you control a small cat in a mini-open world set within a bustling, Japanese-inspired metropolis. Your goal is to find a way home, but plenty of distractions and opportunities to help fellow animal friends or cause chaos will likely delay your departure. 

Yars Rising - Late 2024

Wayforward and Atari are teaming up for a 2D Metroidvania spin-off of the 1982 classic Yars’ Revenge. This side-scrolling platformer stars Emi Kimura, a young hacker (using the handle of Yar) who gets embroiled in an intergalactic conspiracy centered around a corrupt corporation. Yar can blast robots, climb platforms, sneak through vents, hide in doorways, and more. 

Refind Self: The Personality Test Game - Summer 2024 

This 2023 choice-driven adventure stars an android whose creator has passed away. Unaware of its purpose, you’ll piece together your past by interacting with characters and making decisions to determine what the doctor had in mind for you. Decisions mold the android into one of 23 personality types. Are you a hero, researcher, artisan, or gambler? Whichever the case, Refind Self encourages multiple playthroughs, and you can share results and compare choices and personality results with other players. 

Sticky Business - Today

First arriving last summer, this cozy shop simulator is now available on Switch. Players run a sticker shop where you’ll use over 400 elements and effects, such as sparkles and glitter, to fulfill specific customer requests. Giving customers their desired stickers causes them to open up to players and share their individual stories. The Plan with Me DLC adds new sticker elements and customer stories, and a bundle containing the DLC and the base game is also available. 

Antonblast - November 12

As Dynamite Anton or Annie, smash through levels to reach Satan himself, who stole your prized spirit collection. Levels begin by setting bombs, then use your powerful hammer to smash enemies through destructible environments Reaching the end triggers a timer where you must race back to the start before the entire level detonates. A demo will be available later today, and Antonblast will launch as a timed console exclusive when it releases. 

Valley Peaks - 2024

As a mountain-climbing frog, use your tongue to swing across mountain peaks to place radio towers and reestablish communications with fellow climbers. Each mountain presents its own platforming puzzle, challenging players to find the correct path. Along the way you’ll find equipment to ease climbing, play minigames, and take on side quests from other froggy climbers

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes - May 16

This Annapurna-published non-linear puzzle game finally hits next month. Created by the team behind Sayonara Wild Hearts, players control a woman invited to take part in a project set in an old European hotel. Her journey becomes a nightmarish and surreal adventure sporting over 100 puzzles with shifting mechanics and perspectives. 

Europa - 2024

This vibrant sci-fi fantasy game could be mistaken for a Studio Ghibli joint. Players control an android boy with a jetpack-like device who explores a picturesque alien moon. Soar through levels to uncover the secrets of a lost civilization. A free demo is available later today. 

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - July 2024

Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive, this roguelike adventure sees the Turtles traveling through reality-bending portals to find a kidnapped Master Splinter. Each turtle has their own abilities to take down the Foot Clan and other familiar foes, with every room granting new powers and upgrades. Spending earned currency at the sewer base unlocks permanent upgrades, and you can play alongside three other players in drop-in/drop-out co-op. TMNT: Splinter Fate is launching on Switch as a timed console exclusive. 

Cat Quest III - August 8

Sail the seven seas as an adorable feline pirate to engage in navel combat alone or with a friend in co-op. When you’re not sailing the waves, you're blasting enemies in dungeons using a refined combat system with tighter combos and new weapon swapping. 

Stitch - Today

Embroidery fans rejoice! Apply those skills (sort of) to complete over 180 Picross-esque puzzles, called Hoops, to bring embroidery patterns to life. Completed hoops can be replayed endlessly in free play mode where you can recolor them as you wish. Limited daily puzzles offer tougher challenges, and weekly hoops are themed after holidays and other real events. First released on Apple Arcade, Stich is a console exclusive on Switch. 

SteamWorld Heist II - August 8

The sequel to SteamWorld’s 2015 turn-based strategy game takes to the seas. New features include the ability to perform trick shots to ricochet enemies off each other, a revamped job system, and an interactive world map with real-time naval combat. You can befriend new steambots to join your crew and your actions impact their lives.

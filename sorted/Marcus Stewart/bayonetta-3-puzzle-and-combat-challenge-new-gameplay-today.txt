  Bayonetta 3 Puzzle And Combat Challenge | New Gameplay Today






            Our Bayonetta 3 cover story blowout continues with an extended look at Bayonetta 3’s Shibuya section. Join hosts Wesley LeBlanc and myself, Marcus Stewart, as we commentate on unedited portions of our Bayonetta 3 gameplay video. 

The footage shows off the complete time traveling Cereza puzzle we showed in our previous video detailing the game’s new features. We also present a combat challenge room in its entirety, plus as a few stylish skirmishes with the Homunguli in Tokyo’s ravaged city streets.

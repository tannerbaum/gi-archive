  Building Our Own Zelda Dungeon In Quest Master | New Gameplay Today






            Quest Master answers the prayers of a certain segment of the Zelda fanbase by letting them create their own dungeons. With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus' custom dungeon to show off some of the game's toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

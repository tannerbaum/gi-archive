  Watch Yamcha Get Blown Up Again In New Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Trailer






            A new trailer for Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero takes aim at Dragon Ball Z’s earliest story arcs, the Saiyan and Namek sagas. New characters from both eras will be joining the roster. 

New fighters include members of both the Ginyu and Frieza Forces (remember Cui?), the Namakian warrior Nail, and every form of Frieza during the Z era. Perhaps most hilariously, you can even play as one of the Saibamen, meaning we get to watch it blow up Yamcha all over again, which never gets old.

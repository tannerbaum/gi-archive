  Capcom Next Recap: Dead Rising Remaster Gameplay And Release Date, Kunitsu-Gami Demo, And Small Tease For The Next Resident Evil






            Capcom Next was a more succint affair this summer. It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here's a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title. 

Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess

Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on. The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become available in the full game at launch via an update.

Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster

The remaster of the 2006 zombie romp is coming on September 19 (a physical version arrives in November). We got our first look at gameplay and several graphical “before/after” comparison shots showcasing how dramatic the presentational improvements really are. The game will run at 4K 60FPS and features real-time lighting that changes with the time of day. Gameplay improvements include the ability to move while aiming, an autosave feature, a better UI, and improved NPC behavior. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 

Resident Evil 7: Biohazard on iOS and Mac

The latest RE mobile port features improved touched controls and a new auto-aim/auto-fire feature for those who desire extra assistance. Menu and inventory is now touch compatible. Capcom reveals the first section of the game is free-to-play, allowing players to give it a try before committing to a purchase. 

Additionally, Capcom confirms what was likely already obvious: a new Resident Evil is in development. RE7 director Koshi Nakanishi is apparently back at the helm and stated, "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after 7. But I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you're excited for the day I can."

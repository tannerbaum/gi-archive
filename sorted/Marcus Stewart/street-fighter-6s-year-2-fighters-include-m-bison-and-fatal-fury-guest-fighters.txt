  Street Fighter 6's Year 2 Fighters Include M. Bison And Fatal Fury Guest Fighters






            Street Fighter 6’s next DLC fighters were revealed during Summer Game Fest. Series villain M. Bison and Elena are on the way and are joined by special guests in the form of SNK's Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui. 

An animated trailer shows off the Fatal Fury guest characters – a first for Street Fighter – while in-game cinematic reveals a rather disheveled M.Bison who looks as maniacal as ever. These four will kick off a new Year of add-on fighters now that Akuma has wrapped up the Year 1 offerings. They'll arrive in the following order:

M. Bison - June 26
Terry - Autumn 2024
Mai - Winter 2025 
Elena - Spring 2025

  Jun Kazama Purges Evil In Tekken 8 Gameplay Trailer






            A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.

A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son.

  Homelander Delivers Gory Justice In His Mortal Kombat 1 Gameplay Trailer






            Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.

The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June.

Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

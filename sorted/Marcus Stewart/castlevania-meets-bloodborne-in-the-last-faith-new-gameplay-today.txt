  Castlevania Meets Bloodborne In The Last Faith | New Gameplay Today






            The Last Faith is a new gothic action game that blends Castlevania's exploration and platforming with Soulslike challenge and progression to create a promising blend. Players control Eryk, an amnesiac warrior afflicted with a mysterious ailment corrupting his body and mind. His quest becomes a race for time as he searches for a cure, pitting him against an unholy suite of monsters looking to cut him down. 

Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore an early slice of the game, take on the first boss, and show off some of the deadly weapons at Eryk's disposal.

  Resident Evil 4 Remake: Exclusive Chapter 5 Gameplay Walkthrough






            The remake of Resident Evil 4 is Game Informer’s cover story for February, and as part of our ongoing features, we’re sharing extended footage of the game’s fifth chapter, set right after Leon meets Ashley.  

I, Marcus Stewart, and video editor Alex Van Aken played this chapter at Capcom’s headquarters for our cover story. You'll get a great look at the section we played as well as our commentary for added context. The footage includes extended looks at the church and cemetery sequences, a demonstration of combat and exploration, capping off with a larger slice of the chaotic cabin battle with Luis Serra.

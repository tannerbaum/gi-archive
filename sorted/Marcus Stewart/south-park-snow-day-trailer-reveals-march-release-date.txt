  South Park: Snow Day Trailer Reveals March Release Date






            South Park: Snow Day, the upcoming four-player cooperative adventure first announced in August, is coming on March 26. A new trailer shows off more of the game’s frosty action and, of course, the series’ signature foul-mouth humor.

As the New Kid, players join Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny on an epic quest after a blizzard blankets the Colorado town, and school is canceled. Like South Park: The Stick of Truth, the adventure is told through the lens of a make-believe high-fantasy adventure, but Snow Day ditches turn-based combat in favor of a more action-oriented experience. 

Players can use different melee and ranged weapons, wield magic and other abilities, and customize their character with various clothing. Snow Day can be played with up to four friends, alongside strangers in online matchmaking, or as a solo experience with A.I. allies. 

South Park: Snow Day is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

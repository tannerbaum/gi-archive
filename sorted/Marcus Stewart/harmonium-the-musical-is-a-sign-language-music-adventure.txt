  Harmonium The Musical Is A Sign Language Music Adventure






            The Odd Gentlemen, makers of games like The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom, have announced Harmonium The Musical, a melodic adventure game.  

It stars Melody Mecato, a young deaf girl and musician who loves performing. She wants to make it home for her big show but finds herself facing a powerful force that can only be beaten by the power of music. The whimsical game is told entirely through American sign language, including Disney-style elaborate, interactive musical numbers. Check it out below. 

Harmonium The Musical is coming to Xbox (and Game Pass) as well as Netflix.

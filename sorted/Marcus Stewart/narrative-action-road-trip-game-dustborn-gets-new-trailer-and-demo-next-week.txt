  Narrative Action Road Trip Game Dustborn Gets New Trailer And Demo Next Week






            Dustborn, the narrative action road trip game developed by Red Thread Games and published by Quantic Dream, received a new trailer during today’s Future Games Show. We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.

Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below.

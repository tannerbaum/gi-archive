  Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth Still Looks Ridiculous In These New Screenshots






            Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.

The images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. 

Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers.

  Kuma Bears Ill Will In Tekken 8 Gameplay Trailer






            Now that Tekken 8’s 32-character launch roster has been unveiled, Bandai Namco has been releasing gameplay trailers for the fighters that didn’t get one the first time around. It's Kuma's turn now, and the fighting bear is embearrassing challengers left and right.

Sporting a sweet headband and rugged gi, Kuma looks to be an unbearably challenging opponent. His furious paw swipes show he has no problem bearing arms, even against his perennial crush, Panda. In fact, she could bearly stand up to him! But don’t take my word for it. Bear witness to Kuma’s grizzly carnage by watching the trailer below. 

Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check out our recent hands-on preview of the game's story mode here.

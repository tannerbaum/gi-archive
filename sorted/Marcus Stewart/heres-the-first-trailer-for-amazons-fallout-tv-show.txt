  Here's The First Trailer For Amazon's Fallout TV Show






            After years of waiting, Amazon Studios has released the first trailer for its upcoming TV adaptation of Fallout. The series is set to premiere on April 12 on Amazon Prime, and this teaser proves that visually speaking, the series appears to faithfully capture the essence of Bethesda’s beloved RPG.

Fallout is brought to life by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell as a freshly emerged Vault 33 dweller named Lucy and Walton Goggins as a gunslinging ghoul aptly dubbed “The Ghoul,” and the series synopsis reads as follows:

Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them. 

The trailer packs in what a lot of fans would expect from a Fallout adaptation: power armor, vaults, irradiated, mutated creatures, exploding headshots, and a dark sense of humor. Here's hoping it can live up to recent live-action success stories such as The Last of Us and Twisted Metal.

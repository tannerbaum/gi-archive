  Sea Of Thieves Sets Sail For PlayStation 5 This April






            Sea of Thieves is the last Xbox first-party game officially confirmed for a new platform. Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.

Sea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. 

As associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.

  Stop A Death-Dealing Paintress In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, A Slick-Looking Fantasy RPG Coming Next Year






            Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of the brand-new reveals during today's Xbox Game Showcase. Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number. 

Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is "33" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these "Expeditioners" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.

The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and sports slick-looking turn-based action. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming in 2025 to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including launching day one on Game Pass), and PC.

  PlayStation 5 Cloud Streaming Arrives This Month For Premium Users






            If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 

The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 

Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have "hundreds" of titles support this feature in the future. 

Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:

Japan – October 17

Europe – October 23

North America – October 30

As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming's mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you're a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming? Let us know in the comments.

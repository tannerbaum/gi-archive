  How Another Code: Recollection Revitalizes A Cult Favorite | New Gameplay Today






            Another Code: Recollection is perhaps the best kind of remake. It takes two well-liked yet obscure graphic puzzle adventures in 2005's Trace Memory for DS, and 2009's Another Code: R - Journey Into Lost Memories for Wii (which never launched in the U.S.) and gives them a graphical and mechanical overhaul to make them readily available to a new audience.

Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off Recollection's improvements and additions compared to the originals and discuss why you may not want to sleep on these adventures this time around.

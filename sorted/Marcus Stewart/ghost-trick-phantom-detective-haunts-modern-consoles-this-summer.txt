            2011's Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective rises from the dead and will possess the Switch, along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, this summer. 

The news comes by way of today's Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It's up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.

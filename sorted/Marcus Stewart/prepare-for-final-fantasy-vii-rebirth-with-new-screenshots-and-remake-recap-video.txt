  Prepare For Final Fantasy VII Rebirth With New Screenshots And Remake Recap Video






            Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. 

The video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. 

Square has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. 

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.

  Loot River | Game Informer Live






            We’re sailing down a river laden with treasure and dangers today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we explore two hours of Loot River!  

Loot River is a run-based action roguelite with a unique Tetris-esque form of navigation. You must carefully – and strategically – pilot geometric platforms to send your character down gloomy streams to battle monsters and collect loot. 

Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Jill Grodt, who scored Loot River an 8.5 out of 10 in her review writing, “Loot River reimagines some of its inspirations' best elements, offering players a chance to sail cleverly through each environment, grow powerful enough to slice up once-impossible threats, and unravel a story that smartly weaves into its gameplay.” Be sure to tune in to the stream to see what the commotion is about.

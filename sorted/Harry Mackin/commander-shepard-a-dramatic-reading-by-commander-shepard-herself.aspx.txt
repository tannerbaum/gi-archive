  "Commander Shepard": A Dramatic Reading By Commander Shepard Herself






Youtube channel Sneaky Zebra recently uploaded this very special dramatic reading of Miracle of Sound’s “Commander Shepard” lyrics as read by Jennifer Hale, voice actress for Commander Shepard. The result may be smothered in idiom, but it is still considerably more simulating than scanning for Iridium. 

The tale so expertly told details Commander Shepard’s lasting legacy as a legend to the soldiers of Earth. If you close your eyes, you can almost see Shepard explaining herself to Garrus after easily beating him in a sniping competition again (Paragon players know she missed on purpose).
Jennifer Hale is one of video game’s best known voice actresses. In addition to playing female Commander Shepard in all three Mass Effects and many other roles, she will have a part in Hinterland’s upcoming The Long Dark. If this dramatic reading got you excited for more Mass Effect, here’s the latest news on how development of the next installment is proceeding.

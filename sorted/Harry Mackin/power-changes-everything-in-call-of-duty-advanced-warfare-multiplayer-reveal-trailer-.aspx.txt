Sledgehammer and Activision kicked Gamescom 2014 week off today by releasing the Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare multiplayer reveal trailer. The gameplay footage below illustrates how Advanced Warfare’s future technology will change the way we play Call of Duty multiplayer. 
The most immediately apparent change noticeable in Advanced Warfare’s multiplayer gameplay comes from the shooter’s new Exo Armor. The player in the trailer leaps high into the air, breaks through plate glass windows, slams forcefully into enemies, and slides across the ground into cover. The Exo Armor abilities lend a level of verticality and physicality to map traversal and combat unprecedented in the series so far. New multiplayer maps are designed to accommodate this increased freedom of movement.

The exo suit isn’t the only future-tech on display in the multiplayer trailer. We also get a glimpse of the the new kill streak bonuses and rewards— including a signal-able cluster missile, which a player uses to destroy a large robotic mech unit. Map hazards are also prominently on display, with the future soldiers running, leaping, and swimming to get out of the way of a huge tsunami bearing down on them from the sea.
The new weapons and gadgets of Advanced Warfare have a significant bearing on how the first person shooter’s multiplayer feels, as well. At one point, the player uses a laser weapon with a continuous beam fire to mow down an opponent. Scanning technology that illuminates enemies on-screen is used for a tactical benefit. The ballistic shield is used to block bullets in mid-leap. Even a jetpack is used to get the jump on an opponent.
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is coming out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC on November 4, or a day early if you opt for the Day Zero edition.

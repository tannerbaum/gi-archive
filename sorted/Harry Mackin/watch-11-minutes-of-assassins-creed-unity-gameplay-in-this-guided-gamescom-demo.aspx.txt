A new Gamescom 2014 demo features 11 minutes of Assassin’s Creed Unity gameplay, narrated by creative director Alex Amancio. You can watch the whole demo below, which follows protagonist Arno on one of his first missions as an Assassin.

The demo-walkthrough is pulled from an early “black box mission” in Unity’s single player campaign, in which Arno is tasked with killing a Templar named Sivert near the Notre Dame Cathedral. Arno is noticeably inexperienced with asssassinations at this point in the game. He turns to a mentor figure for advice, only to be told he’ll have to make his own way.

As the mission unfolds, Amancio explains that the black box missions, in which all main assassinations take place, are designed to encourage the player to make their own decisions regarding how to approach and dispatch their target. Just as a defiant Arno later tells his fellow assassin, “I’ll do it my way,” Amancio hopes this new mission configuration will give Unity players the opportunity to play the game the way they want. 

Assassin’s Creed Unity is releasing for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 28.

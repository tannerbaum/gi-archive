At Microsoft’s press conference earlier today, creative director Sam Lake presented a live demo of Remedy Entertainment’s new Xbox One Exclusive action game, Quantum Break. The extensive gameplay premier demo is over eight minutes long, and you can see it here right now. 
In Quantum Break players take control of Jack Joyce, who has gained the ability to manipulate time from an experiment gone wrong. The gameplay demo below features Jack using his newfound powers to combat some sort of paramilitary organization that seems to be after him.

The ability to stop time looks like it's as helpful in a fight as you’d expect. Jack can use his ability for a number of different kinds of attack, like freezing time to run up to an enemy and knock him out, freezing an enemy in place to line up a shot easily, or even stopping time to run to better cover or hide. Jack’s time powers have a significant impact on how each fight turns out, with enemies constantly looking around to see where Jack’s gone, or dropping dead suddenly as time resumes.
Quantum Break is scheduled to release exclusively for Xbox One in 2015.

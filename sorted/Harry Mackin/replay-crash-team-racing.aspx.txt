  Bonus Replay – Crash Team Racing






It is a bright, new day for Replay. After outsmarting the Replay staff (and sneaking into Game Informer's office in the middle of the night), interns Harry Mackin, Dimitri Gedevanishvili, and Wayne Stainrook have taken over Replay, and we're doing things our way. The first Replay of the new regime is of course Crash Team Racing, the greatest kart racer ever made.  
Crash Team Racing is a kart-racing game released for PlayStation in 1999. It's the last Crash game developed by the franchise creators, Naughty Dog. On an otherwise peaceful day for Crash and his team, an evil extraterrestrial named Nitros Oxide arrives on Earth. Oxide, who calls himself "the fastest racer in the galaxy," challenges the citizens of Earth to race for the fate of their planet. Should Crash or any of the other Earth heroes emerge victorious, Oxide will leave Earth. If they lose, however, the evil racer will enslave Earth's inhabitants and turn the entire planet into a parking lot. 
In our Replay Roulette, we check out yet another multiplayer Crash game, the mini-game based Crash Bash. Join me, the newly appointed President of Video Games (or "Better Reiner"), along with my Vice President, Secretary of Video Game Defense, and unknown pizza-eating video producer for this look back at the adventures of everyone's favorite manic marsupial.

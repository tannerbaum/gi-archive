The Gamescom trailer for the PlayStation 4 exclusive Dark Souls successor Bloodborne begins with a cryptic warning: “Dear friend, take heed: the blood is foul, and when night falls, the hunters return.” Check out the latest gameplay trailer of From Software’s upcoming action-RPG below to get a taste of Bloodborne’s brutal world. 
Based on the new in-game footage, which features beautiful-if-eerie Gothic Victorian towns and castles, horrific, crazed enemies, and hulking eldritch abominations, surviving the nightly hunt in Bloodborne will be every bit as harrowing as we’ve come to expect From software’s games to be.

Two days ago Ubisoft announced Toy Soldiers: War Chest, the continuation of the Toy Soldiers franchise, which it acquired the rights to from Microsoft in March. Now, the publisher has released a new batch of screenshots showing off the new-gen cutesy splendor and disciplined military might of the two currently announced factions. 
Toy Soldiers: War Chest is a tactical action game in which players take control of one toy army and lead forces, assemble towers, and coordinate defenses to defeat their plastic foes. Developer Signal Studios were in charge of the previous two titles in the franchises, Toy Soldiers and Toy Soldiers: Cold War, as well.
The two playable factions announced so far are the adorable fairy, teddy bear, unicorn army, led by the perpetually happy Starbright, and the serious, rigorous German WWI soldiers, led by the stern general Kaiser. Along with Starbright and Kaiser’s forces, two more as-yet unannounced armies will be playable when the game launches early next year.   
Toy Soldiers: War Chest is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on the upcoming tower defense/ tactical action title, check out the reveal trailer.

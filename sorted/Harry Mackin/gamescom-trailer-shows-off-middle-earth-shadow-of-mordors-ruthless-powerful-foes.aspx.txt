In Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor coverage up to this point, we’ve learned a lot about protagonist Talion and his wraith companion Celebrimbor, but this Gamescom 2014 trailer sheds some light on the powerful enemies the ranger faces off against. In the trailer below, we see visions of Sauron’s sons, and the Black Hand, and a powerful orc demands the head of the gravewalker.  
In addition to getting a glimpse of the dark powers, which are used against the player (it looks like Talion won’t be the only one to employ dark powers in his quest), we briefly see a flashback to the resurrected ranger’s past, and watch his wife and daughter die as the foe responsible mocks him. The trailer culminates with some gameplay footage of brutal looking boss fights, and a brief appearance of the Dark Lord himself.

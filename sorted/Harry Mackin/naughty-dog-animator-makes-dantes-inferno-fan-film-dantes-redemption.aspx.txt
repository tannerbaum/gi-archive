  Naughty Dog Animator Makes Dante's Inferno Fan Film "Dante's Redemption"






Naughty Dog’s Senior Cinematic Animator Tal Peleg is a huge fan of Visceral Games’ 2010 action game Dante’s Inferno, so much so that he animated and directed “Dante’s Redemption,” a fan-made short film. You can check out the short, which stylishly details Dante’s journey into the bowels of Hell to rescue his beloved Beatrice from the hands of Lucifer, below. 
At the beginning of the video, a note from Peleg explains that part of what he wanted to do with “Dante’s Redemption” is capture the raw physical power and martial skill of Dante. The action-packed short film certainly accomplishes that, featuring an unstoppable Dante doing battle with Hell hounds, knights, and even Death himself.

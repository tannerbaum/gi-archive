  PlayStation And Xbox Twitch Accounts Compromised, Offensive Messages Posted






Yesterday the PlayStation, Xbox, and eSports League Twitch accounts were accessed by an as-yet unknown third party, who altered posted highlights to contain unauthorized messages including offensive language in the titles and descriptions. The unauthorized messages included jokes concerning recent announcements at Gamescom 2014, fake game announcements, and offensive slurs and swearing. 
Some of the messages posted made fun of Microsoft and Sony, including one about the announcement of Rise of the Tomb Raider as a timed exclusive that read, “Sorry guys but they rose the money bags.” The poster also announced new Fallout and Gears of War games. Other posts contained only swear words, or racist and homophobic slurs.
Twitch believes the poster gained access to the companies’ accounts at Gamescom by finding a computer that was logged-into the accounts at the venue. Twitch has deleted the highlights and broadcasts posted by the compromiser, and the teams working at Gamescom have been altered. Other highlights and past broadcasts are also temporarily removed from the affected channels as a precautionary measure.

Our TakeThis is certainly embarrassing for all companies involved, but it seems like Twitch is handling it in a suitably responsible manner. Hopefully no one was too offended by the immature things posted.

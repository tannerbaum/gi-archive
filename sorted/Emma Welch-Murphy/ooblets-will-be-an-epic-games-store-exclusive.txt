  Ooblets Will Be An Epic Games Store Exclusive






The anticipated, cute, indie Ooblets has just become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Developer Glumberland says it still plans to release on Xbox One. The PC version of the game will come to other storefronts as well but it is going to be much further down the line.

Glumberland says it has seen the controversy surrounding other developers' decisions to become an EGS exclusive, but the team still sees more to be gained than lost. Through the deal with Epic, Gumberland says it has enough money to keep the lights on and expand the team to improve the game before launch.

Glumberland says that the investment might delay the game's launch because "we won’t have as much financial pressure to prematurely shove something we’re not happy with out the door."

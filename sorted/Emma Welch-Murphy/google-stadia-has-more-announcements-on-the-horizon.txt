  Google Stadia Has More Announcements On The Horizon






If you're still on the fence about the Stadia gaming service, then Google is hoping to sway you with its upcoming livestream on August 19. It won't be long until the service is up and running for those who paid ahead of time. Google's also opening up its booth to curious passersby at Gamescom 2019 in Germany, and people will be able to test it out for themselves.

Let’s do it again. On 8/19, #StadiaConnect is back and bigger than ever. Tune in at 10AM PDT / 7PM CEST for all the details - then come get hands-on with the future of gaming for yourself at our #Gamescom booth! https://t.co/dKmKakQeQp pic.twitter.com/H0ILSxki8r

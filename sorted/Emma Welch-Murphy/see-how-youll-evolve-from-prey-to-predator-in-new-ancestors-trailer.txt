We all hail from small beginnings, but in Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, you start from scratch as you navigate your own history of evolution. 

Ancestors is all about discovery. Surviving won't always be as simple as finding a rock and using it as a tool. Players must find ways to take care of their family, fend off predators, and even scavenge for food. The game wants to guide players as little as possible and figure out Darwinism themselves. This recent developer diary gives a broad overview of the mechanics and how players will evolve their species.

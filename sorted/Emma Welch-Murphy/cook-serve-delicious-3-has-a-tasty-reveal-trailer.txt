Watching this trailer is definitely not a good idea to do when you're hungry. The Cook, Serve, Delicious! franchise is back and ready to solidify its trilogy for the Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch. With early access coming in 2020, we'll have plenty of time to decipher what new elements were revealed in the trailer above. 

This time around, it seems players are going to be serving up food in a food truck driving around a post-apocalyptic world with robot assistants. This is a big transition from the previous installments, which just involved a regular present-day restaurant-sim scenario. Despite the new additions, players are still able to cook up some delicious-looking meals in a fast-paced environment.

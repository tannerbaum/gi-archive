  Pragmata Looks Strange And Fascinating






            The most baffling-yet-interesting trailer to come out of today's PlayStation 5 event was for Capcom's Pragmata. It shows a high-tech astronaut walking the deserted streets of New York, firing off a projectile that fills the air with particles. Then he activates a device that projects some holographic echos of people who once occupied the same space.

After that, gravity reverses, the world gets full of static, a young girl activates some machinery with her mind, and then they stop a satellite from crashing into them.  

Who knows what it all means, but we'll learn more before Pragmata's scheduled release in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.

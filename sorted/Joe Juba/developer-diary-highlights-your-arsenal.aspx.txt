Hunt: Showdown is an Old West gothic-horror competitive survival game. If you think that sounds like a lot of ideas for one game, you're right – but that doesn't mean developer Crytek can't pull it off. What we've seen of the game so far has us excited, and the latest developer diary dives deeper into the weapons at your disposal.
How does the team recreate late-1800s guns? How does that process compare to designing more fantasy-inspired weaponry? These questions and more are addressed in the video below. 

For more on Hunt: Showdown, check out the first dev diary about its premise. You can also read about why it impressed us at E3 this year.

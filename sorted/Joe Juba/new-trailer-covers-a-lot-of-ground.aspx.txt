Metroid: Samus Returns is an enhanced remake of Metroid II, which released on the original Game Boy. However, this new 3DS version doesn't look or play like a game from the '90s. 
To emphasize the various combat improvements and exploration features, Nintendo has released an overview trailer that touches on many elements. From power-ups to story elements, the video below should give you a full picture of what to expect without spoiling too much.

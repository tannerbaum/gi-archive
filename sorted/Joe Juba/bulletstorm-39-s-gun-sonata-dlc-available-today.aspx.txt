  Bulletstorm's Gun Sonata DLC Available Today






With a name like "Gun Sonata," you'd think this DLC pack would have a bunch of cool new weapons. Instead, you get some new maps...though that's pretty cool, too. The DLC is available right now on Xbox Live, and will be on PSN later today. The PC release of Gun Sonata is still happening, but it isn't out today. Look for that one at some ambiguous point in the future.So, what exactly do you get for your $10? Gun Sonata includes 2 new Echoes maps and 3 new Anarchy maps. You can read the official Xbox Live listing for the content here.Bulletstorm has been out for almost two months now...are you still playing it? If not, are these new maps enough to bring you back?

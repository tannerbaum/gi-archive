  Desolation Brings Horror To No Man's Sky






            Hello Games' sci-fi exploration sim just got another update, and this one isn't as peaceful as some of the previous free content. The latest addition to No Man's Sky is called Desolation, and it lends a decidedly Dead Space flavor to your outer-space adventures.

According to the announcement from Hello Games, Desolation has players exploring haunted, derelict freighters. The freighters are atmospheric, procedurally generated spaces populated by rogue A.I. and hostile aliens. However, if you brave the dangers, you can find valuable salvage. Get a taste of the action from the trailer above.

Desolation also includes less scary tweaks, like new visual effects, customization opportunities, and balance changes. You can see them all for yourself right away; the Desolation update is available now for No Man's Sky on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

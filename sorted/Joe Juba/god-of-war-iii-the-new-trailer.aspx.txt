  God of War III: The New Trailer






            Just in case you weren't already super-pumped about the upcoming March 16 release of God of War III, Sony has released a new trailer to fuel your thirst for vengeance. In a post on Sony's official blog, game director Stig Asmussen gives a litte bit of context for the trailer: "We really wanted to sell the high action of the game and put together snippets of several of the big moments. Everything is pulled straight from the game â€“ there is no trickery, etc. Everything is running in 'real time.' There are no 'cinematic' sequences here, meaning this is all gameplay."
Now that you know what's going on, check out the video below.

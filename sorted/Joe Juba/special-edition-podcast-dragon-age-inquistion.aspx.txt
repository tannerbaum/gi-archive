  Special Edition Podcast â€“ Dragon Age: Inquistion 






To conclude our month of exclusive Dragon Age: Inquisition coverage, we asked our readers to submit all of their questions about the game. They responded in full force, and we put those questions to creative director Mike Laidlaw in this special edition podcast.

We touch on a wide range of topics, and Laidlaw clarified some of the big reveals from the last week, including the Keep and the confirmation of the Qunari as a playable race. Give it a listen below and let us know your thoughts in the comments.

  Final Fantasy VII Remake's First Part Is All About Midgar






Since its original unveiling, Final Fantasy VII Remake has undergone some changes. However, we know that the project is still a multi-part experience. At Square Enix's E3 presentation, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed more about the scope of the first installment, and it's apparently focused on the iconic city of Midgar.

"The first game in this project expands on the story of Midar, and is such an elaborate retelling that it has become a solid standalone game in its own right," Kitase said.

Don't let that fool you into thinking the game will be short; Kitase said Square Enix anticipates "two Blu-ray discs worth of gameplay content."

Midgar took about five or six hours to play through in the original version of Final Fantasy VII, so getting an entire dedicated game is quite a step up. It's an understandable move for Square Enix, though; when fans think of Final Fantasy VII, Midgar is the one location that stands above all others.

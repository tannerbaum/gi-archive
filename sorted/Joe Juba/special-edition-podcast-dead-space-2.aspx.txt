  Special Edition Podcast: Dead Space 2






Concluding our month of Dead Space 2 coverage, we divulge everything we know about the new survival horror shooter. In this special edition podcast, Joe, Nick, and Ben answer reader-submitted questions about this sequel to one of the scariest games ever made. We visited Visceral's studio, talked to the staff, and saw the game in action â€“ and we use that info to give you an in-depth look at how the team is bringing everything together in an effort to make Dead Space 2 even better than the original.

Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2: Innocent Sin


  Menus, Dialogue, And A Little Combat




Combat is only one part of the RPG formula, and the latest batch of Persona 2 put the spotlight on many other facets. Maps? Menus? Dialogue? All represented. 
Of course, there is one token shot of a battle. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll see plenty more in the weeks to come. Persona 2: Innocent Sin was never officially released in North America, so this PSP version will be many gamers' first crack at this particular adventure in the Shin Megami Tensei universe.
See below for the full batch of screens. If you want to get a free soundtrack with your copy of Persona 2, you should definitely read this story. For more about the game's user-created quests, read this.Persona 2 hits shelves on September 20.

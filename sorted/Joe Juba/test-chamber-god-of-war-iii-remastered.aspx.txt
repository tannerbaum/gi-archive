  Test Chamber – God Of War III Remastered






God of War III was one of the best games on the PlayStation 3, and we're getting another chance to experience the action with God of War Remastered on PS4. With today's release of this new version (read our review), players can get reacquainted with their chain blades and get ready to take on the gods. 
Join our resident God of War fanatics Joe Juba and Andrew Reiner as they take a look at the remastered final chapter in Kratos' saga. With improved visuals and performance, this quest for revenge looks better than ever. Don't take our word for it – watch the video and see for yourself.

  Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown Announced






            The Test Drive Unlimited has been dormant for years; the last installments were Test Drive Unlimited 2 in 2011 and Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends in 2012. Since then, the IP has changed hands – today it is owned by Nacon. Now, with developer KT Games behind the wheel (the team behind the recent WRC titles), Test Drive is racing back to relevance with a brand new entry.

Apart from confirming the game's existence and name (Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown), not much solid info is available beyond the brief teaser trailer above. According to a Nacon press release, the game "retains the DNA of the series, which is based on a love of beautiful cars and the joy of driving around a luxurious island world recreated at 1:1 scale."  

More info regarding platforms and a release date are undoubtedly in this game's future, so keep your eyes on the road.

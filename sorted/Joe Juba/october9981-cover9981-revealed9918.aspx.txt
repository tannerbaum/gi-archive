  October Cover Revealed: BioShock Infinite






            Irrational Games recently revealed BioShock Infinite, but what you already know about the game is just the beginning. Our exclusive cover story is packed with new info about Columbia, protagonist Booker DeWitt, his companion Elizabeth, and the monstrous titan that rules the sky above the city. Our BioShock Infinite covers, which were just unveiled onstage at PAX, are a significant departure from our normal look. Instead of using our traditional layout, we worked with artists at Irraional Games to produce covers that showcase what a video game magazine might have looked like on Columbia in the early 1900s. With illustrations inspired by period publications like The Saturday Evening Post, all three covers also feature unique advertisement for products a citizen of Columbia might need. You can also look forward to several other cool features, including four pages on Call of Duty: Black Ops' multiplayer, an analysis of the gaming industry's upcoming Supreme Court battle, and in-depth impressions of Move and Kinect. This issue also features previews of Fallout: New Vegas and Dead Space 2, along with a review of a little game called Halo: Reach.Click the images below to see high-res versions of all three covers below, and come back throughout the month to visit our BioShock Infinite hub, where you'll find even more exclusive details on Irrational Games' upcoming project.

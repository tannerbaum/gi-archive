  The Top 5 Hottest Springs In Ghost Of Tsushima






            Ghost of Tsushima is available today, and it is wonderful. Your time on the island of Tsushima is punctuated by many activities, from saving farmsteads to composing haiku. However, at the end of a long samurai day, nothing hits the spot like a soak in a hot spring. You find many such springs as you explore, and players are already debating which ones are the best. Which has the best view? The most steam? The coolest tree? However, don't get too lost in details; the defining characteristic of a hot spring is its hotness, and we're ranking the five hottest right here and right now.

            This is probably a pretty hot spring, but it's simply too dark to know for sure. And if you've ever been in the tub when your power went out, then you know bathing in total darkness is not relaxing.

            The spring looks nice and hot from this angle. However, all those leaves flying around are going to land in the water and feel slimy on your skin – and that kills the mood. Fish 'em out with a net or something first.

            Those candles really create some nice ambiance, and look at all the steam! This hot spring is a total smokeshow.

            You can have too much of a good thing. Ghost of Tsushima is an M-rated game, but even so, we had to censor the spring in this image because it was simply too hot.

Since its initial SNES release as Final Fantasy II, this RPG has seen
 re-releases on PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and Wii’s Virtual Console
 – plus a full 3D remake on DS. Even though I’ve played Final Fantasy IV
 more than any other game in the series, I never get tired of it. 
Whether you’re a longtime fan like me or a newcomer who can’t tell Kain 
from Cecil, you can’t go wrong with Final Fantasy IV: The Complete 
Collection. 
As the name implies, this compilation gathers 
everything related to FF IV in a single package: the original game, the 
sequel (called The After Years), and a brief interlude bridging the gap 
between the two. Thankfully, you can access all three installments from 
the main menu right away, so you don’t need to start at the beginning if
 you’re already familiar with the base game.
Final Fantasy IV is 
great by itself, so the addition of the extra content just seals the 
deal. The After Years wasn’t received well as a downloadable episodic 
game on Wii, since doling out the story piecemeal over several months 
and charging gamers for each chapter isn’t a good way to keep them 
interested. This collected format suits the plot much better; when 
played as an uninterrupted adventure, After Years held my attention like
 it couldn’t before. The graphical upgrades (which the base FF IV 
shares) also make the experience better, forming a consistent visual 
style across the entire saga.
Since FF IV and After Years are 
already available in other forms, Interlude is the only new piece of the
 puzzle. Unfortunately, it’s the biggest disappointment on the disc. 
Calling it a full game is a stretch; the story took me less than four 
hours to complete, and most of that time was spent in three dungeons 
repeated from FF IV – identical layouts and everything! Even so, I’m 
glad I played it, since the tale ties neatly into the events of After 
Years.
If you’ve somehow managed to overlook Final Fantasy IV over
 its numerous incarnations, this is the best way to get the whole 
experience. Though not every facet is airtight, The Complete Collection 
is an addictive mix of traditional RPG mechanics, character-focused 
narrative, and pure nostalgia.

  Vader Immortal Hits PSVR On August 25






            Vader Immortal debuted last year on Oculus systems, giving players a chance to come face-to-face with the iconic Star Wars villain in VR. Back in May, we learned the game is also coming to PSVR. During today's State of Play event, Sony confirmed that the title will be launching on August 25.

So, should you pick it up? The first episode is interesting, and has some recognizable voice talent (including actress Maya Rudolph) ... but the subsequent installments didn't quite keep up the momentum. Even so, if you're a Star Wars fan and you want to stand in the awesome presence of Darth Vader, the game's move to PSVR is a new opportunity to do just that.

  Fable Is Officially Coming Back






            The Fable series has been a beloved part of Microsoft's catalogue ever since the first installment on the original. Created by the now-closed Lionhead Studios, players connected with Fable's heroic feats, storybook style, and emphasis on player choice. Despite some missteps, many fans (including us) have been following the rumors and hoping for a new RPG installment in this franchise. During today's showcase, Microsoft finally made it official: Fable is back.

Developed by Playground Games, the Microsoft-owned studio behind Forza Horizon, the upcoming Fable is a fresh start for the series. The trailer didn't reveal much more than that, but it's still big news!

Fable will release on Xbox Series X and PC, and will be part of the Game Pass program. Microsoft did not reveal a specific release date, but the fact that the game is not also coming to Xbox One means that it is a long way out considering Microsoft's commitment to bring first-party titles to both Xbox One and Series X for the next couple years.

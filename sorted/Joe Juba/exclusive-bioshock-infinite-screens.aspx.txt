  Exclusive BioShock Infinite Screens






Now that our October cover has been unveiled, it's time to get a better look at BioShock Infinite with these three exclusive screenshots.  The images showcase the outdoor environments of Columbia, from the war-torn streets to a park with an idyllic gazebo. Columbia's visual style is a departure from the underwater corridors of Rapture, and this is an intentional shift in direction. If the original BioShock's artistic vibe could be summed up as "New Year's Eve, 1959," the phrase that the team at Irrational uses to describe Infinite is "Fourth of July, 1912." 
You don't need to take my word for it, though. Judge for yourself by clicking on the images below to see the full-sized screens.
Be sure to pick up a copy of the latest issue to see even more exclusive images, including an in-game shot of the 30-foot behemoth chasing after Elizabeth and Booker. Also, don't forget to check out our BioShock Infinite hub all month for even more in-depth info!

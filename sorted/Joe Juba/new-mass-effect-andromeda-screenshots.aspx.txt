  New Mass Effect Andromeda Screenshots






Amid all of the talk about the characters, missions, and other details, the fact that Mass Effect Andromeda is a gorgeous-looking game might get lost in the shuffle. Built in the Frostbite engine, Andromeda uses the power of current hardware to create beautiful worlds and detailed creatures – but you don't need to take our word for it. Check out the images below and see for yourself. 
These new screens are from our cover story (so they may not be new to you if you've already pored over that), but they also come with some additional explanation and context.

This vehicle is called the Nomad. It's like the Mako from the first Mass Effect, except it controls better and doesn't have any offensive weaponry. Rather than create two different combat systems – one for on-foot and one for vehicles – the team at BioWare decided refine just the third-person gunplay. The planet the Nomad is driving across is Elaaden, a scorching (and optional) desert world. 

Scanning is a big part of your progression. As you explore, you scan objects like lifeforms and technology, and that information fills out your codex and gives you more info on the world. However, it also feeds into the crafting system, unlocking new recipes for weapons and armor. 

If you like throwing gouts of flame, you aren't restricted to a particular class. Because of Andromeda's flexible skill system, Ryder can learn any ability, and isn't locked into a single progression tree. This capability is unique to Ryder as the Pathfinder; other party members fill more traditional roles. 
That's it for the screens, but we have a whole month of coverage planned for Mass Effect Andromeda, so click on the banner below to enter our hub of exclusive content.

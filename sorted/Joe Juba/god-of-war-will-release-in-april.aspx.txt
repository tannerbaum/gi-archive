  God Of War Releases On April 20






Fans have had many questions about God of War since its initial reveal at E3 2016. Why Norse mythology? Why does he use an axe? Why give him a son? Now that we have answers to those questions, Sony just needed to answer one more big one: When does the game come out?
According to the latest trailer, God of War releases on April 20, 2018. That isn't too far away, so start sharpening your axe.
That's not all the information we get from the trailer, though. It gives new insight about what sets Kratos and Atreus off on their journey, and the issues they confront regarding their godly lineage. It might be a bit spoilery, but if you don't care about going into God of War completely fresh, you can watch the full trailer below.

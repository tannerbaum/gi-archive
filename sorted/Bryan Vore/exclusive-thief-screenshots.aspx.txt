  Exclusive Thief Screenshots






Our recently announced Thief cover story is loaded with details and imagery, but there are two screens you haven't seen anywhere else. Be sure to click on the images to see them blown up in full detail.

The screen above shows Garrett doing what he does best. This ornate bottle is one of the many valuable items players will scout out and steal throughout the game.

This shot provides a wide view of the House of Blossoms, the lavish brothel that Garrett infiltrates during the demo that we saw for the cover story. Notice all of the dark corners to hide in and tempting valuables to grab.
If you missed it, check out our Thief cover reveal, and be sure to return to the Thief hub for new stories and videos all month long.

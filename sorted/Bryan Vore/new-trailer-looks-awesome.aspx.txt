Aliens: Infestation


  New Trailer Looks Awesome




October 11th is almost here, along with one of the last potentially great DS games: Aliens: Infestation.
This Metroid-style exploration shooter comes from WayForward, the people who brought you Contra 4. Rest assured these guys know a thing or two about killing lots and lots of aliens.
Anyone else as pumped for this one as I am?

  March Cover Revealed: The Last Of Us






Ever since its debut video in December, The Last of Us has shot to the top of many gamers' most anticipated upcoming games. The trailer ran on in-game assets and the engine, but it didn't show an actual part from the final game. We visited Naughty Dog's studio to see a full segment of The Last of Us played live, talked to the team members about their inspiration, and landed a ton of details you won't find anywhere else.Â

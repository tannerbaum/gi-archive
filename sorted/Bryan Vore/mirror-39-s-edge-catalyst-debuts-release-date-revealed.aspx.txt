She battles against the oppressive forces of Gabriel Krueger (We'll have to verify the spelling). The game takes place in one large open-world city featuring missions, time trials, and races. There will be no loading screens or traditional linear levels. 
Mirror's Edge Catalyst will launch on February 23, 2016.

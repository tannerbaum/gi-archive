  Exclusive First In-Game Screenshots Of The Last Of Us






As promised earlier today in our cover announcement story, we present three screenshots from The Last of Us.The images below are only a taste of the over 20 great shots that appear in the March issue. Be sure to click on the screens to get a better look.
Combat includes both gunplay and melee attacks. Weapons will break after repeated use, so you'll have to scavenge around for new items frequently.
Most post-apocalyptic worlds are bleak and gray. Naughty Dog utilizes natural growth to spice up the color palette and add a sense of the abnormal. Notice the yellow bridge in the background? Yep, this is Pittsburgh.
The developers stress that The Last of Us is not one long escort mission. Although you won't control Ellie in the game, her AI is one of the team's primary areas of focus. In our demo she always managed to keep up, yet stay out of the way. She didn't seem to need any babysitting at all.
Be sure to check back and visit the hub all month long for more on The Last of Us.

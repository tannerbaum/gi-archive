  South Park: The Fractured But Whole Announced






Ubisoft today revealed the sequel to South Park: The Stick of Truth.
Kicking off the company's press conference, South Park: The Fractured but Whole (try saying it out loud) will pick up where the last game left off. You still control the new kid, but all of the kids in town have moved on from fantasy to super heroes. 
Trey Parker and Matt Stone appeared onstage to talk up the game, and mostly complained about the headset mics they had to wear. They had previously said they didn't want to make another video game, but they changed their minds once enough time went by. 
Developer Ubisoft San Francisco is taking over for Stick of Truth studio Obsidian. No release window has been provided at this time.
Check out the debut trailer!

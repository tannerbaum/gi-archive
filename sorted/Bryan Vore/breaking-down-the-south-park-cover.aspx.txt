Our South Park cover is crammed full of characters from all 15 seasons of the show. See how many you can name and find out more about the ones you missed.
To see the name of a character, simply mouse over it and wait for it to appear. If you want to read that character's bio or see them in clips or episodes, click on the character and you'll head over to southparkstudios.com. As usual, the South Park website contains mature content.
Use the image above to scan all of the characters who are right side up (plus the dragon in the lower right corner). Check out the image below to learn more about the characters that only appear upside down in the lake's reflection.

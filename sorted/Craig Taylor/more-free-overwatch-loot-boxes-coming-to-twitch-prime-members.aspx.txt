  More Free Overwatch Loot Boxes Coming To Twitch Prime Members






Starting next week, Twitch Prime members will receive five free Overwatch loot boxes. 
If you're a Twitch Prime member from August 10 to September 10, you can get a redeemable code for your in-game rewards here. Twitch Prime members can also expect five more loot boxes this October.  Note, these are not seasonal event loot boxes, even though the upcoming Summer Games 2017 event starts August 8.
Anticipate less duplicates, as Blizzard has updated the loot box system to "dramatically" reduce the amount of repeat cosmetics.
And if you enjoying empathizing with other people's misery, watch us open 25 loot boxes from the Anniversary event as we try to score the legendary Pharah skin.

Our TakeIt's starting to get out of hand how much value you get from Amazon Prime. On the Twitch front, you get to support your favorite channel at no additional cost, watch streams ad-free, and receive in-game rewards. It sucks the loot boxes aren't seasonal, but at least you can build up some currency towards that legendary you have your eye on.

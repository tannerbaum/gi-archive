A new trailer reveals more of what hockey fans can expect in NHL 18's arcadey, 3-on-3 mode.
By default, NHL Threes' gameplay is more over-the-top, with bigger hits, faster skaters, and harder shots. There's also a randomized money puck, which can give your team extra points, or take away from your opponents' score. Both of these features are customizable if you'd prefer a more realistic Threes experience.
This trailer reveals some more details surrounding Threes, namely the singleplayer campaign mode, where you travel across different circuits to unlock new players, jerseys, logos, and more. Also announced in the trailer is the addition of mascots in Threes (perhaps this is the "more" that players can unlock by playing the Threes campaign).
If you want to try Threes for yourself, it's playable in the NHL 18 beta, which is now open to everyone on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

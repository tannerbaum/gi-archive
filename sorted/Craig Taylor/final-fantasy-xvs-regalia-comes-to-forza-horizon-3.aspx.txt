  Final Fantasy XV's Regalia Comes To Forza Horizon 3






Starting August 1, qualifying Xbox One and PC users will get to take a spin in Final Fantasy XV's iconic luxury car, The Regalia, in Forza Horizon 3.
Anyone who's played Forza Horizon 3 or Final Fantasy XV on either Microsoft platform should receive a free code in their Xbox Live messaging inbox, according to the company.
This isn't the first time Forza Horizon 3 has had DLC from other franchises; the Halo Warthog, Fallout-inspired vehicles, and even Hot Wheels have all been added to the game as DLC.

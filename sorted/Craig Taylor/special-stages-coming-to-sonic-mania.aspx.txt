  Special Stages Coming To Sonic Mania






At the Sonic Mania panel during San Diego Comic-Con, Sega revealed that Special Stages are making a return.
In Sonic games, Special Stages are hidden levels where the objective is to obtain one of the six Chaos Emeralds. Traditionally, collecting all of them unlocks the true ending of the game.
You can listen to the background music of one of the Special Stages here.
Additionally, more details on the Sonic Mania vinyl were revealed at the panel. The Sonic Mania LP will feature 16 new tracks chosen by composer Tee Lopes, and will come in 3 colors: black, translucent blue, and a limited edition blue/red/orange/yellow splatter. The vinyl is available for pre-order here.
Sonic Mania will be available August 15 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

Our TakeI'm not a game music guy, but even I can tell that the soundtrack for this game is shaping up to be killer. The Sonic Mania LP might be the one vinyl worth buying for the music on it, instead of just to sit on your shelf as a collector's item.

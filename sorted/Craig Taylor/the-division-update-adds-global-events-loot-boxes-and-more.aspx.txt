  The Division Update Adds Global Events, Loot Boxes, And More






The Division players can look forward to tomorrow's update, which adds new classified sets, commendations, and "encrypted cache" loot boxes, among other things.
In The Division's global events, participating players will earn new classified gear and vanity items. Some events will have global modifiers, which affect the entire map in fun, interesting ways. There are also activity modifiers, which make tasks more difficult but offer greater rewards. The first global event is called Outbreak, with more events on the way.
Update 1.7 also adds new customization items and classified gear sets. There were five classified sets shown off in the developer update: Sentry's Call, Dead Eye, Reclaimer, Striker, and Final Measure. These sets offer better primary stat rolls, new recalibration options, and additional five and six-piece set bonuses.
Finally, the update adds new cosmetic options. Players can unlock wearable patches by completing tasks of varying difficult. You can also re-customize your character's face, meaning you can finally ditch that crappy haircut you picked when you first made your character.
You'll be able to unlock exclusive emotes, outfits, and skins by finding and unlocking "encrypted caches." These caches can be unlocked by finding keys within the world or by using premium currency.

Our TakeI stopped playing The Division a long time ago. That being said, I'm sure there's a dedicated following of people who are happy to see things like global events uniting the community. Even if it is well over a year after launch.

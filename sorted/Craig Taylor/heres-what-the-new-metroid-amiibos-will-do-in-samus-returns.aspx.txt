  Here's What The New Metroid Amiibos Will Do In Samus Returns






Nintendo is releasing two new Metroid amiibos alongside Metroid: Samus Returns this September. Both of these will have in-game functionality, as will the two previously released Samus amiibos from Super Smash Bros. 

First up, the Samus Aran (Metroid Series) amiibo will give you a free Aeon reserve tank when your Aeon energy runs out. You'll also get to view in-game Metroid II art after beating the game.

Next, the Metroid (Metroid series) amiibo will give you a Metroid marker that will tell you the location of the nearest Metroid. You'll also unlock Fusion difficulty after beating the game, which allows you to use the Fusion Suit.

Tapping the Samus (Super Smash Bros. Series) amiibo will give you a missile reserve tank, which works similar to the Aeon reserve tank. You'll also get in-game concept art after clearing the game.

Finally, Zero Suit Samus (Super Smash Bros. Series) amiibo provides an energy reserve tank when used. You'll also get access to the sound test mode after beating the game.

Our TakeIt looks like Nintendo saved the cooler bonuses for the amiibos nobody has yet. Well, at least they're good-looking, and I'm sure any Metroid fan would be happy to have one on their shelf (assuming you can find them when they go on sale).

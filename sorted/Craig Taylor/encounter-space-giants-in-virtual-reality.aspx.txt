Star Child


  Encounter Space Giants In Virtual Reality




Star Child is a space-themed sidescroller played in virtual reality. Rather than utilizing VR as a way to immerse the player from a first-person perspective, Star Child instead opts to use virtual reality as a way to enhance its third-person camera.
Star Child’s E3 2017 announcement trailer follows the player character as she navigates past towering mechs and mystical interstellar creatures. Towards the end of the trailer, she is gently picked up and comes face-to-face with a gigantic machine. It'll be interesting to see if developer Playful can magnify the player's sense of scope by utilizing virtual reality.
Star Child will release on PlayStation VR. No release window was given.

  GTA Online Adds New Sports Car And Juggernaut Mode






Grab your friends, buckle up, and rev the engines. The classic Pegassi Torero sports car is available now for all GTA Online players.
Rockstar describes it as a "a sleek, scissor-doored classic that reflects Pegassi's time-honored tradition of balls-to-the-wall design twinned with bone-splintering performance." Best of all, you can get a head start on upgrading this bad boy with 25% off all engine upgrades through July 31.
Also new is the "Power Mad" mode, where players fight over control of a powerful juggernaut suit. The person who scores the most points as the juggernaut wins. If you try out Power Mad, you'll get double XP and cash through July 31.

Our TakeI have absolutely no idea what kind of car this is supposed to be, so if someone in the comments could tell me if adding it is a big deal, that'd be great.

  Game Informer's Top Scoring Reviews Of 2020






            The pandemic has led to a much lighter release schedule that we usually see in any given year, but 2020 has still delivered a number of fantastic games. Whether you are gaming on a PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, or PC, the Game Informer staff has reviewed most of the year's notable releases, and given them their proper critique. Was a highly anticipated blockbuster worth the wait? Are there any indie games that you didn't know about that are must plays?

This list gives you a rundown of 2020's best scoring games from the top scorer down. Any game that scores between a 10 and 8.5 makes the list. We also provide a notable quote that hopefully sizes up the game along with a link to the complete review. The year is just getting started, and we'll update this list whenever a new game fits the criteria. Happy gaming!

Disney Infinity


  Jack Sparrow and Tonto Finally Meet – And It's Just As Awkward As Expected




To show off Disney Infinity's toy box mode, a new trailer shows Captain Jack Sparrow and Tonto in a collision of fictional universes. 
Sparrow in particular was expertly animated to show off Johnny Depp's humorous portrayal of the character from the popular Pirates of the Caribbean series.
The toy box mode will allow characters from multiple franchises, such as Toy Story and Monsters University,  to meet up, allowing characters from throughout the Disney universe to finally be in the same playspace.

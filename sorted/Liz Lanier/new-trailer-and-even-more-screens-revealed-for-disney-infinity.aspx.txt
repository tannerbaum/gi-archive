A few new screens for Disney Infinity were revealed to add to our previous collections of images. And now there is also a trailer available to show off gameplay.
Sorry, this video is not available
The screenshots look very colorful but offer no explanation for why Buzz is on top of some characters from The Incredibles or where Jack Sparrow got that bike.
Perhaps those answers will only be found out when the title comes to Xbox 360, PC, Wii, Wii U, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 3DS on August 18.
Visit our E3 News Headquarters for all the stories from the show.
